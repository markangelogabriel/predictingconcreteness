I would start making plans and scheduling in catch up times with friends and family via video conferencing. For things we would usually do regularly like family dinners instead maybe be could video conference together at the same usual time etc. This would not feel the same as we are used to and will be very different this will make us sad. Change can be difficult. We could look into online games we can play together that will make us laugh and have fun.  We still feel isolated as we cannot leave our house nor can we have visitors but  we are feeling connected with others.

We relate in an amicable way with almost all other people and during my working life and membership of a city council and other formal committees and boards I had plenty of friendly acquaintances/colleagues though very few close friends. The exception is our immediate family - children and grandchildren, my brother (now 93 yo), my niece and nephews (who were our adopted children). With them we feel extremely close and normally spent a good deal of time with our descendants and some of the others every week - generally doing things for them in the case of daughters and grandchildren, or talking on the phone with others. Now our daughters do our shopping for us and bring things to us, often bringing a son with them, but maintain social distancing and do not enter our house. We maintain brief chatty connections with some neighbours, maintaining social distancing. IF I felt isolated and lonely it could only be caused by insufficient contact with those people, and with our daughters' husbands and grandson's pregnant wife. We currently speak by phone with one daughter or the other every day. Therefore IF I felt lonely and isolated I would first spend more time in the same room as my wife. Currently I work (at age 83 I manage several large portfolios on my computer and research family history) in my study while my wife spends most time on household duties and watching TV or reading in the family room. My wife has a disability that almost precludes her using a keyboard or mobile phone, so although knowledgeable she cannot physically help me. Then I would telephone my daughters and married grandson more often, although that is made difficult by the fact that one is a director in a govt department, one is the business manager of a very large college, and the third is a very intensely employed electronic engineer, and are not supposed to take private chatty calls at work. I would then try to reconnect with old friends from over 15 years ago (when I was employed) though unfortunately I have let them rather ""drift away"" due to my own rather solitary nature that always enjoys a discussion but has never enjoyed just chatting. My two major outside activities have both been closed down - attending university ""lectures/addresses"" with my wife and friends and attending the gym every other day at which I tend to meet the same people even though I don't know their surnames - so nothing much can be done about that. It would take a prolonged effort of perseverance to reconnect with old friends who I let drift away, and there would be some disappointing failures, but I would make that effort and it would end with greater connectivity. Now that I reflect on it, my absence of effort to reconnect is driven by some apprehension about rejection of the attempt. The current covid-19 situation has a strange psychological effect. My wife and I agree that apart from not going shopping and my not going to the gym, where I exercised and did not ""chat"", and missing maybe one big get-together with family or friends per month, statistically things are not all that much more confined. It is just that the compulsion makes it feel that way. 
In a nutshell the challenge is not one that I am experiencing; and in fact if I were beginning to feel that way I think I would try to suppress the feeling by immersing myself more in my work",JL,,2.5,1.5,1.5,1.0,0,17/04/2020 4:53,100,True,1205,R_1K2yvreUvapYJkw,I CONSENT to participation in this research study.,83.0,Male,,Yes,WA,Yes - past,Postgraduate University Degree(s),Retired,,,Northern/Western European,,No,23,23.0,Slightly negative impact,None,1,None,None,No pets,Very,,,,,,2020-04-18 06:53:00,58.169.84.4,100.0,R_22y3Mox1hw9ZgTI,0.0,,,59.0,treloard@bigpond.net.au,2.0,0.0,8.0,0.0,60.0,33.0,0,2020-04-19 18:15:00,100.0,R_3UiTQUvCrPFQ1S9,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,14.0,,42.0,,2020-04-20 18:36:13,100.0,R_2dH2g3cOmddDMwu,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,9.0,,44.0,,2020-04-21 19:10:07,100.0,R_vcbrQLSRjUxH5CN,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,15.0,,53.0,,2020-04-22 19:04:07,100.0,R_2ZBN8JaCCrJVKwj,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,34.0,,55.0,,2020-04-23 18:40:53,100.0,R_YafR69SyB0JrwE9,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,14.0,,55.0,,2020-04-24 19:47:25,100.0,R_3fJiSwz4Nm7WUx7,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,15.0,,52.0,,2020-04-25 20:01:00,100.0,R_2zBbLOZdUXjCMXK,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,69.0,10.0,2.0,5.0,,,2020-04-28 01:01:25,100.0,R_3RgqYdK2L8BnyqA,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,25.0,,56.0,,2020-04-29 05:32:19,100.0,R_2dxXnOK3f4xPtP8,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,,50.0,,2020-04-30 07:18:21,100.0,R_OvRzlJ0ZiJXW6Bz,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,13.0,,55.0,,2020-05-01 05:39:36,100.0,R_1f16zkI1xGs6XVa,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,,54.0,,2020-05-02 05:39:07,100.0,R_1rNfU19NsIL3wK5,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,39.0,,54.0,,2020-05-03 04:16:54,100.0,R_2dhjjy29hDrk9Kg,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,24.0,,55.0,,,100.0,R_XBPZAO0KyYnVDtD,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,70.0,8.0,2.0,27.0,,

If it is because I haven't engaged with friends / family for a while I think about who is around and how best to engage with them.  I live by myself but am lucky that I can always speak to my parents on the phone or by email, and I connect with friends in different ways.  I try to actively keep track of when I last caught up with each of my close friends. Some of them are up for talking on the phone or by video call and some prefer text or email.  That gives me a variety of ways to keep in contact and minimise any feelings of isolation. I try to ensure that I connect with at least one friend each day in way that helps me feel connected and a way that they like.  My friends and family who live interstate and overseas seem to be more up for video chats than my Perth friends, so I have also found that I am having more regular video chats with those friends who I would usually just keep in contact with via Facebook posts.

It turned out that my wife was also having feelings of disconnection. Habits had been established over this time in which we tended to do the same things routinely each day, such as play Sudoku, have breakfast, do crossword puzzles, sit at our computers and watch TV with maybe a little exercise thrown in. All of these activities were becoming very tedious. Something needed to be done. So we decided to take a close look at what we could do to be more connected to one another as it looked as though we could be together like this for an indeterminate length of time.
We have since found many things which we can do together rather than alone, for example two handed card games, things we can research together on the internet and going for long walks in the bushland around our house.
So we look on this as a positive change in our lives and a timely reminder of the need to remodel our way of life.

I need some kind of system to help streamline decision making. Therefore, I could brainstorm possible options for feeling connected to other people, and note possible benefits/requirements for each option. For instance, if an option is 'do a digital art collaboration with a friend', possible benefits might be feeling more connected as well as feeling fulfilled from engaging in art, and requirements might be: an internet connection and browser; a drawing tablet and pen; an art app. I would try to choose activities that would help me combine connecting to other people with my other self-care goals, such as fitness and study. I could also ask friends and family about what they would like to do and add those options to the brainstorm. Depending on people's schedules, I could then organise to do activities from the brainstorm with people. I'd try to aim to do a variety of activities so that I wouldn't feel 'burned out' or overwhelmed from the same constant connection, but still with some kind of regular schedule to stop from slipping into chaos. I'd make notes on the effect that various activities had, just to determine what does and doesn't seem to work for me, and I would adjust options as I go based on these notes. I would feel more connected and closer to people as a result, and also more satisfied in regards to my other self care goals.

I remember that my friend has recently bought a bike, so I contact him to see if he is interested in going cycling at a safe distance together. He is, so I order a bike from my local store, itâ€™s important for me to support local business, and plan to go for long rides at the weekend. But thatâ€™s a few days away. I miss my weekly pub quiz, so I spend time at the weekend writing a quiz to play on zoom, and spend time making sure that the questions arenâ€™t to hard or easy, and that I can play music and picture rounds too, so that the quiz isnâ€™t dull. I try to make the questions relevant to the experiences of our friendship group, Regardless of whether the question are about science or history or sport. This process makes me feel connected to my friends even without actually playing the quiz. I organise the quiz and we play at a time that isnâ€™t too late for friends in melbourne to join. On Saturday morning I ride down to the river to meet my friend and we go for a long ride and even though weâ€™re too far apart to have a conversation it feels like good interaction. In the evening we play the quiz and spend two hours laughing and chatting on zoom. I feel appreciated and connected a bit less isolated.

So I would write in my journal what these feelings of isolation and loneliness looked like and hopefully narrow it down to which part of my life was struggling. If I felt that it would help, I would go and find my Mum, she's usually free and would love a chat or a cuddle. Then I might ask if she wanted to go for a walk because fresh air helps me think more clearly. Then I might call or message my boyfriend if I felt that it would ease the specific feelings. I would usually tell him how I was feeling and ask if we could talk about a topic that I knew would sooth my feelings. In this case, it might be a funny story from the past or dreams about our future, whichever would bring up less anxiety. Then I might organise a zoom call with my friend group for later in the week. In these zoom calls we like to talk about the future as if it will be normal soon, rather than dwelling on the losses we have going on right now. After all this, if I was still feeling isolated, I could do a Smiling Mind mindfulness activity, listen to a podcast, make a cup of hot chocolate or watch some Netflix. Distractions usually help if you can't fix the problem.

I would message them and ask if they would like to go out for a walk with me around the area to catch up and have a chat (while maintaining our 1.5m distance). I would feel loved by others wanting to spend time and effort with me, and connected to those around me.

I tell myself not to get caught up in the things I canâ€™t change and focus my energy into the things I can change. 
I focus on the people I want to connect with, my spouse and close friends. I think about why I want to connect with them - to share experiences, to feel reassured and to provide some respite from what is happening, and talk about things out loud rather than keeping them internalised. I decide how to connect with these people - itâ€™s a discussion with my husband, and a text message reaching out to my friends with quickly results in a video call with 2 friends at the same time.
I feel relief about sharing my feelings, and that my worries and feelings of isolation and loneliness are valid and justified, and real and normal. We share experiences and support eachother and admit that communication is the best medicine, and that we are all in this together even when weâ€™re apart. We discuss different ways to stay connected and manage our anxieties both individually and together. We reassure eachother that we are here for one another and that it is ok to feel down.

Firstly, I tell myself that, given the circumstances, it is reasonable to feel that way. I also tell myself the the feeling of ""disconnect"" will pass and the lock down will end eventually.
I read / watch the news so I know what was happening in the world. 
I use technology to connect with family and friends (phone, text, Facebook, facetime...).  I have ""group chats"" with my family and friends. It boosts my mood when I interact with others. I miss seeing my family but I do not feel lonely.
I sit on my balcony so I can see other people moving about.
I read books for a bit of ""escapism"". I do crosswords to pass the time and exercise my brain.
I feel a little bit of ""cabin fever"" if I think about social isolation too much so I make sure I have things planned to do (eg joined an online book club, joined an online exercise class) so I interact with more people.
I try old skills eg knitting - I feel a sense of achievement.
I tell myself that complying with all the rules is the right thing to do to keep people safe. I feel good that I am doing my bit.
I order online and have my groceries home delivered.  I spend more time preparing meals and tell myself that eating better is a positive outcome from lockdown.

I find if I don't give a specific time, people often don't join the call. I think this is due to differences in everyone's schedules - different people are generally online at different times so without a scheduled hangout its hard to get many people together. After organising a time, I would also give a specific activity we could do (for example, watching a movie together on Netflix using Netflix Party). This also helps people get involved. I find my friends take more active steps to be involved in the hangout if there's a specific goal we're going to achieve.

First I would make a list of family, friends and neighbours whom I can contact via phone, video and/or email. 
Secondly look online for people in my neighbourhood who have groups that meet online with similar interests. e.g. bookclub, gardening enthusiasts. 
Third I would increase my activity on social networking siteâ€™s  - Facebook, instagram 
I start with phone calls to family and friends because these people are in my comfort zone. 
Then I would do some research online to see what type of groups etc are out there. What their rules are. What age group theyâ€™re targeting. Decide if I want to join a closed group or public. 
After collating what I have found make a decision. Maybe ask to join them all. Or select one to two I like the most and will be actively interested in what is being talked about.
And the third part of the plan while online Facebook and Instagram. Update these accounts. Add something new, daily on both. Check my settings see who can see my feed. Open it up to family and friends. Add new groups, interests.

No physical interaction for weeks

Call local friends to try to organise a walk with one keeping to social distance
If walking alone say good morning with a smile, make me feel better
Investigate emergency volunteer agencies, council website
Produce leaflet to drop into local letter boxes offering assistance. May meet neighbours to expand local contacts
Discover what craft can be made using stash to offer to  charities for when things open up.
Be proactive with communication with friends and family and not wait for them to contact.
Ask others regularly if they are ok.
Take on caring role for others which in turn helps me

As much as I love being at home it can be a downward staircase that slowly chips away at my happiness. Each day leads to a slow decline in motivation, self care, engagement, patience, love and support for my self and family. 
It is only on reflection I tend to realise the decline to be able to know that there was a decline. 
Itâ€™s my responsibility to kick start myself back up again. To realise that only I can make the changes that turn  this around. To mentally realise how my emotions, moods, feelings and actions are effecting me day to day as well as effecting my family and their moods. It is mentally challenging to be a Mum and wife, if that is on the decline there is a lot that goes down with it. It is isolating in the way that the more I decline the less contact I make with friends and family, the less I care then feel guilty about causing a negative thought cycle.
I need to make the decision to change my mind. That decision needs to be a daily change to ensure a plateau is created then an incline established. Iâ€™d do this by thinking about how Iâ€™m feeling physically. When did I last have a long hot bath or shower to get completely clean and feel really fresh, do my nails or wear something nice instead of shorts and T-shirt?
Knowing that I will feel amazing after this self care period - this needs to be my first step. Iâ€™d then continue to clean and organise common areas, decluttering wardrobes, cupboards, drawers etc.. clean self and environment. Iâ€™d feel the need to get organised to ensure my finances are sorted and up to date, complete a new budget to see if any small debt can be paid in full, if savings can be topped up and if phones plans or other utilities can be lowered. Iâ€™d also want my childrenâ€™s school work to be up to date, to ensure they have timetables so they know what is expected and so do I so I can assist with whatever they are working on. Already knowing these things will be coming up and passing by will give me mental relief, emotional relief and a positive feeling knowing Iâ€™m changing mine and my familyâ€™s futures by making these positive changes now. Having achieved these things and continually finding things to improve myself and future would make me feel proud. Iâ€™d then likely want to take on some sort of DIY project or craft to complete. As these things are achieved I would start to feel proud of myself, and in turn would think that these would be things my family would also be proud of. This would bring about the want to contact my family. Even a txt or photo to them starts the much needed conversation that will lead to phone calls and video chats to share what Iâ€™ve accomplished. It would also mean Iâ€™m giving my time to others for them to share what they have been doing, how theyâ€™ve been feeling which also creates a positive feeling. It would lead to video calls with the children involved that donâ€™t often get to see each other. They can also feel good and have a laugh at their cousins silly faces or pictures they drawn, books theyâ€™ve read. This makes me happy seeing them happy. It is easy to walk the spiral staircase down and it is rewarding to walk back up again. The difficulty is in owning where you are on the staircase, acknowledging a change needs to happen then taking the responsibility of self to create the action to move those steps in the opposite direction. No excuses leads to a self fulfilling and in turn shared happiness.

My day starts at 6am with mental exercises followed by shower the breakfast and cleaning up and washing all the dishes.
I always wash up after every meal and keep the apartment neat and tidy.
Usually, form 8 to lunch time I spend on my computer and chatting with my wife who is locked down in Indonesia.
After lunch I walk for about 1 hour, can't do much walking as I'm on the waiting list for knee surgery , and then I rest up and have a nap until about 4pm.
Watch the news, quiz programs and the cook dinner, wash the dishes, and the watch TV until about midnight....then sleep.

Firstly, I text my friends to organise drinks at wine oâ€™clock.   We have tried Zoom drinks, which can be entertaining.
Secondly, I read the news and message my friend to discuss various tidbits.  This is a regular thing we've always done regardless of COVID isolation.
Thirdly, I get off the couch, and go for a walk.  I pick up my mail from the local PO.  I chat (at a distance) with neighbours who are outside.   The walk kick-starts my brain for the day.
Then it is time to start work.  I work for a solid 4 hours.  4 hours work isn't much, but it is productive.  It is good to chat with colleagues via email or Teams messaging.  Intermittently I do housework as well.   I try not to feel guilty at not putting in an 8 hour day, I'll be working much longer hours soon. At the end of the day, I feel that I've achieved something. 
Wine O'clock!  I pour myself a tall drowned gin and soda (I am trying not to drink heavily because it will affect my well-being the next day).. then either get on the phone or on Zoom depending on how many there are of us.   We go over each others' day, comparing notes and activities: who has done more, who managed to leave their suburb today.  
We are all in the same boat!

I always feel energized by talking to others. ,KH,,1.0,1.5,1.5,1.0,0,10/05/2020 18:02,100,True,1701,R_aVuKgzd5wyavRE5,I CONSENT to participation in this research study.,40.0,Female,,Yes,QLD,No,High school graduate,Employed part time,No,Community and Personal Service Worker,Australian,,No,More than 30 days,50.0,Moderately negative impact,2,1,None,None,Dog(s),Extremely,Moderate risk,High risk,Very low risk,Very low risk,Moderate risk,2020-05-11 22:59:00,118.209.25.220,100.0,R_1dmjcyrIKhTJiCt,0.0,,,45.0,gwendolyn.oxton@gmail.com,4.0,16.0,11.0,3.0,47.0,30.0,0,2020-05-12 22:18:00,100.0,R_1onxkL63RRYzF6p,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,26.0,6.0,49.0,5.0,2020-05-13 22:51:18,100.0,R_2WPGcGE2HPN45CD,1.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,14.0,8.0,43.0,4.0,2020-05-15 00:29:57,100.0,R_qzlSq0MrP9eaMBb,1.0,3.0,2.0,6.0,28.0,3.0,42.0,5.0,2020-05-16 01:01:45,100.0,R_1rNACNJJuOfRSNy,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,41.0,2.0,2020-05-17 00:29:08,100.0,R_277r7upETRk2ZKl,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,8.0,45.0,8.0,2020-05-17 22:38:50,100.0,R_TbFCb1PT77NxI9H,1.0,3.0,2.0,9.0,24.0,9.0,34.0,10.0,2020-05-18 22:53:00,100.0,R_1F8s6EbJeotsvrA,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,16.0,55.0,9.0,2.0,21.0,6.0,4.0,2020-05-19 22:22:01,100.0,R_3fE3h3Kv0XG2fCb,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,33.0,3.0,42.0,8.0,2020-05-20 21:48:09,100.0,R_3nBqWsQrSCdQkz9,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,24.0,9.0,43.0,4.0,2020-05-22 11:35:13,100.0,R_27E9LVxBYdHO13i,1.0,1.0,4.0,6.0,13.0,9.0,42.0,7.0,2020-05-23 16:19:39,100.0,R_2rJFjFJI2vjtICR,1.0,1.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,7.0,43.0,4.0,2020-05-24 21:14:28,100.0,R_Didn3xgo2kIA6rL,1.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,28.0,9.0,43.0,7.0,2020-05-25 21:18:50,100.0,R_2AMb5qXvKyVO2if,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,45.0,7.0,43.0,3.0,,100.0,R_2rZcYMejAxl602m,1.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,12.0,57.0,8.0,3.0,46.0,7.0,8.0

Making a list each day of people I intend to call or email which I could tick off once completed would be a start. Using the technological methods such as Zoom to see people face to face regularly would also be of use with several different groups accessed on a weekly basis: family and friends. 
While remaining within social/physical distancing rules, I would make an effort to see a friend for a walk or have a friend visit for a coffee or drink. I would also make sure my husband and I spent some time walking, gardening, or spending close time together regularly. 
Another way I think I would/could connect with others would be to do something for other people each day such as cook something or drop off something or send a gift via online shopping. 
It would also be important to acknowledge those times when I was feeling disconnected and lonely and make an extra effort to call or connect with someone to whom I know I could be honest about how I was feeling. I could also reassure myself that it is likely the situation will improve eventually and more normal human interaction can resume.

Preparing for the video call, I would spend some time making my drink and food look really 'Instagram worthy' because I get a lot of enjoyment from just the preparation and presentation.

1 using eg Facetime with oldest brother & parents
2 ring my other brother
3 send my sister text

1 texting & 1 FaceTime with 2 cousins more often - always great chats :) 
2 text & phone other cousins via Facebook phone & respond to there comments

Friends & Others
1 keep texting & participate in games online eg Scrabble
2 keep the distance but talk while waiting at counters ie food place
3 wave as you pass in the streets & say hello (dogs first & then maybe humans ... really how itâ€™s done!) :)

Who first? Which group of people? Can I do/arrange multiple things? Research groups or places or organisations etc. 
Choices Iâ€™d like to make, compromises Iâ€™m willing to make. Things I donâ€™t want or compromises that I wonâ€™t make. 
Then Iâ€™d start taking action by contacting those people and having the conversations either by text, email, phone or by person. 
Iâ€™d try to firm up arrangements but maybe itâ€™s going to take a while. Iâ€™ll try not to take it personally if someone says no or disagrees with what Iâ€™m suggesting. Their life and wants arenâ€™t a reflection on me or how they feel about me. Iâ€™ll choose to accept their choices if it fits with mine or their choice not to get involved.

Where I find ""positions vacant"" new opportunities, I'll submit formal applications (e.g. Red Cross).  Otherwise, I' make cold calls to organisations such as meals-on-wheels or St Vincent de Paul and offer my services. I already have police checks, working with kids and disabled.

I'll raise a discussion about up-coming events or items on their wish-list.

I would contact my friends who I have not been kept in touch for a while. It becomes often to remember those good old days and friends when I am slowing down and working from home. I would also like to spend more time talking to families over the phone. We are living in different countries and I have not been home for over one year. We are all going through difficult times and it is the time we need each other more than ever. A close, supportive and loving family relationship always provides a sense of connection and belonging. In addition, I would be more grateful for the company and companion with my other two very close friends whom stay in the same house with me. I would suggest to do things together, such as playing a board game, do some reading, having a movie dinner, cooking and gardening. Having quality time with friends always make life more meaningful and joyful. I would also do some volunteer work, such as picking up groceries for the disabled and assisting elderly people with technology problems. Making a contribution to the community can alway increase self worth and high sense of participation. I would connect people taking the same online courses and they are from all over the world.

This may be partly my own doing as I have not had the motivation to keep in regular contact with friends while I was feeling down, even though they tried to engage with me.

I decide to write a list of the people who I would like to reconnect with in various ways.  Some people on my list are relatives or friends.  I decide to write them a letter to ask how they are and explain what has been going on with me.  I have always felt that I can express myself well in a letter where I have total control of what I wish to say and in the way I say it as opposed to not expressing it as well verbally.

If I do not have a mailing address I will send a Private Facebook message or a text but this would not be my preferred mode of contact as I am not overly fond of Facebook.

I would write the names of friends or acquaintances or perhaps a work colleague with whom I have previously enjoyed spending time with or can imagine would be nice to get to know better and then call them to have a chat and perhaps suggest meeting for a walk or a coffee.  It would be an activity that would be relatively short so it would not be too uncomfortable if conversation was a bit stilted.  However, I think it would be fine as I would not choose to approach a person that I did not think had some common ground with me.

I imagine that I will enjoy walking with a friend and would like to make the effort to do it regularly.  

I will also make time to talk to neighbours, even if it is just a friendly â€œHi,  how are you?â€ And also take my dog to the dog park instead of just walking as it is easy to have small talk with someone when you have a good icebreaker like a dog present.  Great Like-minded  friends can be found in dog parks.

Once I have followed through with my plans to reconnect with relatives or friends I know that I am so glad that I made the effort, I feel that I am enjoying the friendship and life in general more. It is good to feel that  I am someone that people do wish to spend time with and care about and likewise, I wish they feel the same in return.

I am very visceral, I like to express myself through touch and emotion. But for me, to have a true connection, there is always that something more, something extra, that you feel with certain people. When you know, you just know. Some people just exist on that same wavelength as you.

I rarely feel like I even belong on this World. For the longest time in my life I felt alone and isolated simply because I did not feel understood or even heard. These days my words seem to carry more weight than ever before; even more than I would like 1. Amazingly, the feeling of emptiness and loneliness has vastly improved since the lock down. I have managed to actually reconnect with almost everyone important in my life now. Maybe this is because everyone was forced to slow down and actually had the the time to. Or maybe it was the lack of pressure to be productive that gave me the energy to do it. 
Either way, I don't feel as lonely or isolated, but I still feel like something is really missing. 
I have that extra connection with these people but i don't have that physical aspect. I need the companionship to complete me. I want someone to be there for me, support me in what I do and stand by my side when things get tough and truly work for us to be the best we can be, together. Just hold me when I need to cry, squeeze my hand just because they like the feeling of it. I want someone who will love and devote them self to me as much as I would to them. 
I know its not me against the World anymore, if anything I have the support of the World behind me. But i still want that partner in crime, that ride or die, the girl of my dreams. 
And I have found her. I just don't know how it will happen. In my dreams I just receive a card in the mail, or under my door, by the powers that be. All it says on it is her name, on the back is where I need to be and what time. I think i'm going crazy but I take the leap of faith anyway; I buy the most amazing flowers I can find and I just go and wait. I desperately hope this isn't some cruel prank. But its worth the risk of embarrassment because I've been searching for her all my life. I want to believe in miracles. 
And then it happens. She appears. It'll be awkward because we only have been together in our dreams, but it feels right. I'll hold out my hand so i can take hers, and i'll kiss it because I am amazed I have the privilege to. Just embracing her is enough to fill my heart and soul with warmth. The romantic in me just wants to get down on one knee right there, it just feels right as well. 

In real life, I come home everyday just hoping she would be there waiting for me, waiting for an embrace. It actually hurts a bit inside when it doesn't happen because its an impossibility. 
All i know though is when I get to hold her in my arms, I'll finally feel complete. I'll no longer have to search for anything. All i have to do is try and be what the rest of the world sees in me. Cause I know if i fall and fail, over and over again, she will be there to help me up and keep me going. She won't give up on me. She will be my muse and motivation. The anchor and sunshine in my life. When I have that love I so crave and desire, I know i'll have realized my destiny and can finally feel like I truly belong in this World.

I have joined The Australian Birdlife organisation and have emailed the Gold Coast group and indicated that I would love to join their field trips and am happy to car pool and also am willing to be a driver. I feel much more like I am part of the world again when Beth accepted me.

- lastly, I would text one of my best friends or my daughter and make time for either a phone or video chat.  We would chat and laugh and Iâ€™d feel more connected. If it were my daughter or my sister in law, we might watch the same show on Netflix.
If I couldnâ€™t do any of those things, I Would look on Facebook and see who is online and chat to them, or comment on their posts.
All of these things can result in me feeling closer to people or more connected.

I normally socialise with friends at work and as I'm not going to work that's not happening these days.  I don't like to contact friends when they're at home because I don't want to disrupt their family time.  They would hate to think of me struggling feeling isolated and lonely though I know that for sure.  I'd now consider ways that I could reconnect with them in a way that works for us all.  I'd start by messaging to see how they're going and whether they are keen for a catch up maybe via a video chat.

I hope this will change as restrictions ease.
Volunteer to help others who are older than me and need some interaction or help buying groceries etc. I have done this and worry that because I am 70 and new to the area that I will not receive a volunteer position.
Once restrictions ease, I would also join the local Bowls Club to join in their activities and hopefully make some new friends.

Our son has a gorgeous chocolate labrador dog. My husband goes to our son's house, which is literally around the corner, and picks up the dog and brings her home. The dog bounds into my bedroom and obviously delighted to see me - as I am her. I certainly feel buoyed by her boisterous and constant attention. My dear husband makes me a cup of tea and brings it to me whilst enquiring if I'd like something to eat. I'm feeling the love! I look outside and see a lovely day with blue skies. My husband suggests that we take the dog down to the opened dog park (Kedron Brook) near us, which we do. The sheer delight of watching the dog's antics chasing a ball, swimming, interacting with other dogs makes my heart melt.

Many years of depression and anxiety have made this a standard step for me when a feeling is impacting my life.

I would ask myself ""is there anyone in particular I need to feel more connected to, or am I generally just feeling lonely and just need interaction with others?""

The answer to that question determines whether I reach out to someone in a particular via a phone call, text, facebook message - being cognizant of the fact that, if I am already feeling lonely and isolated, then my mental state is probably a little fragile. This would mean I would contact close family or friend to whom I can just honestly state how I am feeling, knowing they will listen to me and help me feel better just by chatting either verbally or by text. I would usually message my closest friend. These steps would make me feel connected and closer to other people who are important in my life.

If it's a more general feeling, then I would also call or message a few friends/family or perhaps an existing FB group and ask how they are going and finding out what is happening in their worlds; is there anything I can do to help them etc.

The other thing I would do, is cook a meal for a friend who is struggling either financially or mentally at the moment and drop it over to them. This satisfies my need to help others when I am limited in how I can do so, and I feel connected to them by sharing my time and energy in a positive way that gets me out of my own head for a little while.

I would look at face book, forward anything relevant or positive. Depending on the day, I might go out and sweep the path, do a bit of housework or something a bit physical. Then if the time of day is right I'd ring a family member or friend to have a chat. When I'm walking I say hello to other people walking and I ring my friend and have a chat to her as I walk.  She rarely leaves home so I describe what sort of evening it is, the flowers etc so this gives a nice sense of giving her something special as well as making me feel more part of the greater world outside my covid bubble.

I do this so that I don't feel like I need to leave the conversation because there was something more important or more urgent than connecting with my friend.
2. I would choose who I am going to make contact with. I would imagine what the conversation would be like, how I would start the conversation, what I'd like to talk to them about and what I would like to know about them. I would decide the best way to make contact with them and why that medium. I would make sure that I am feeling safe making contact with that person.
3. I would text (probably) the person in advance to make a time to chat so that it would work for them as well. Doing this means I have made a commitment to connecting to this safe person. I would then make sure the time worked well for me.
4. I would make contact and give myself the opportunity of talking about what was going on for me. Having this connection with people who care for each other mostly ends up with a feeling of close to people, feeling more loved and cared for and more valuable.

I might text a friend prior to a phone call, asking them if they were up for a chat and a cup of tea or coffee, because even though it is not a face to face event, the idea of both of us making a beverage prior to a chat and consuming the beverage over a phone call promotes a further sense of intimacy and connection. 
I have used these steps previously, particularly in these times of not being able to just jump in the car or plan a visit and it ALWAYS lifts my spirits and provides that connectiveness that we are 1 seeking.

I will make a list of everything I can do to alleviate my loneliness.

To Do List

1. Phone my children to see how they are all going.  
2. Organise Facetime with my grandchildren. 
3. Set up a group chat on Messenger with my friends.
4. Interact with my Facebook ""family"" 
5. Watch some UTube.

As I work through my list over the coming days, I realise that, my loneliness is only a sate of mind, talking and laughing with my family and friends makes me realise I am loved and needed and that I am a valued person in their lives and that this self isolation will end soon. 

I am feeling connected and closer to people.

We decided we would walk together the next day for exercise and catch up. It didn't go too well. Lizzy was extremely negative and very aggressive regarding isolation. It made me anxious so I didn't walk with her again. 
I then went through my fb friends that I'd seen lately, prior to COVID-19 and began to video call the ones I knew would be grateful for a chat. It was very successful and I'm sure everyone felt better for the video call.
Then I thought what about friends I don't see regularly. I downloaded the Zoom app and contacted 14 friends whom I haven't seen in a while. All of these I made sure had known eachother for years.  
I organised a zoom meeting and all but one person joined in. It was fun and very stimulating hearing everyone's news and how they were feeling.
A week later I organised another zoom meeting. It too was successful. However only eight friends were able to join. Still a lovely, more intimate chat. It lifted my spirits and made me feel confident.

Get up around 6.30 a.m. shower, dress and switch.  Feeling OK - have been sleeping well - even with binge watching TV when I go to bed.
2.  Go to the study and check all emails, LinkedIn, Facebook. Text and Slack messages.  No new jobs - disappointing but am getting paid for a few weeks more so not feeling too bad.
3. Text small group of close friends to say good morning.  Feeling happy.
4.  Put the dog in the car and go to the local shops to get a coffee and breakfast.  Go to the same coffee shop throughout lock-down so have a chat with them (and occasionally with other people waiting).  Feeling happy - love my coffee and chatting with the girls.
5. Have breakfast back at home, take coffee to the study to catch up with messages on text, Slack, email and FB.  Dog and I share breakfast - he makes me laugh....  Check jobs on LinkedIn - apply if relevant.   Call agency contacts.  Stay in study for a couple of hours with break for tea/coffee/stretch. Feeling OK.   
6. At lunch make a sandwich and clean up - check TV news.  Feeling OK.
7. Go back to the study after lunch to check emails - have a look at LinkedIn articles, look at areas of possible training, online shopping.  Check jobs. Chat with friends by text.  Feeling good when talking to my friends.
8. Mid-afternoon have a tea/coffee and catch up with the news.  Feeling a little bored but OK. Text the group of friends again to find out how they're feeling.  Possibly plan meetup at the weekend.  Feeling better at the prospect of that.
9. Around 4 p.m. take the dog for a walk (approx 30-40 minutes), chat with other dog walkers/householders who know me and my dog on the route.  Feeling really good after the walk...
10.  Catch up with neighbours if they're in the garden. Disappointed if I don't see them.
11.  Bake and take some to the neighbours for a quick chat - baking makes me feel good.
12. Call my son to find out how's he's going in Sydney.  Feeling really good after speaking to him but haven't seen him for some time.   Would love to see him but no prospect of that for now..
13. Call a close family friend to see how his family is going.  Feeling OK that he's OK.
14. Go to the local shops to get food and other supplies.  Have a chat with people in the stores/checkout.  Feeling better than supplies are improving - but I don't really need anything - have plenty of food, loo rolls etc...LOL
15.  Call best friend in the UK for half an hour for a chat.. Feeling great - am hoping that flights to the UK are reinstated by Christmas so I can travel.  
16.  Text the neighbour and either go to their house or have them over to mine for a glass of wine.  Feeling good.
17.  Cook dinner and feed the dog.   Settle down for binge on Netflix with a glass of red wine.  Feeling content. 
18.  7.30 p.m.  lock up and go to bed - switch on TV and continue binge watching - put TV on sleep timer...  Feeling good - looking forward to catching up with friends soon.  Fall asleep...

I would probably create a table on scrap paper, including name, location, time difference, working or not, kids or not (As these factors impact how and when to touch base with people) and method of communication e.g video conference, telephone call or face to face but socially distanced.

Some are family, some are friends and some are members of groups to which I belong. Some of these people I could phone; some I could email and some I could connect with on Facebook or WhatsApp. I like to be organised so I would then make an XL spreadsheet and list people under each type of communication.
Each day, when I have moments when I am wondering what to do to fill my time, I can look at my spreadsheet and select a person to contact. When I have spoken/connected with them, I can put a tick on my spreadsheet.
This gives me instant gratification seeing that I have progressed in my aim to feel more connected.
My family are more likely to return my calls but I feel closer to friends who live a long way away. Often, I haven't contacted them apart from the odd Christmas card but now I have the time to see how they are coping. This has renewed old friendships and makes me feel my time has been well spent.
With regard to groups I belong to, I have started a private Facebook page for our Writers Group. We normally meet once a month and submit 'homework' - a short story, which is critiqued by others. The Facebook page offers the opportunity for our members to read each other's stories and comment on them. I am about to suggest Zoom as a more intimate face to face meeting. I'm not sure how this will work as most of my group are not au fait with this technology. It would be an interesting exercise to help them learn something new.

(b) If just a phone chat, I would call a friend or family member. I would tell them, I was bored/stir crazy/needed to chat. We might discuss some of the worrying things happening, but I would also try to find the funny side and hopefully end the conversation with us both feeling better.

(c) If online connection was enough, I would go to my local area Facebook group and find out what people are doing and feeling in my suburb.

I will switch on the television or play music in the background so I feel less alone, as it helps me to imagine there are others in my home. It also reminds me of times when I am back in my home country with family with the television switched on and us having a good time together. These memories might make me feel a little sad and wistful but they can be quite comforting. 

I will scroll through my phone to see which messages from friends and family I have not responded to. I will estimate how much cognitive and emotional effort it would take to reply to each, and also consider the importance of these people to me, before deciding which people I will reply to first. I will likely feel stressed and tired at the thought of having to hold conversations even via text, but I will persist, knowing it is good for me and that it will bring me closer to people I care for. 

I might even schedule virtual meet ups with one or two close loved ones, to make sure I do not withdraw into my isolated shell, since scheduling these will mean I have to do it. I will probably be reluctant and worried that I might feel really unhappy at having to do so when the time comes around to carry out the meet ups because it is easier to be alone when I am down. But I am likely to convince myself to do it and not overthink things because again, I know this is beneficial for me. 

Having established some contact with people I care for, and having upcoming plans to enhance these connections, will help me to feel connected and closer to people.

Plus Iâ€™ve never been one for having lots of â€˜friendsâ€™ or what I consider acquaintances because Iâ€™m one of 9 kids and used to be part of a huge family who are my friends in the UK. I also moved closer to Brisbane from HK where my husband lives to be closer to my son and look after my grand-daughter 3 days a week. My husband is a long haul pilot based and living in HK. I was very depressed there as I was left alone a lot, Iâ€™m happier in Australia but miss my sister and friends on the Sunshine Coast. People are much friendlier there and happy to take time to have a chat. And herein lies a lot of my problems around being lonely. I used to go and see my sister and her kids every 4 weeks.

I would contact these persons and really be aware of what they have to say, rather than beginning with me venting. I think I am not the only person to 1 feel like this so it would be nice to give others the chance to feel thought of, without feeling theyâ€™re being a prop for me. Being a help to someone is the best medicine. I think there are many more people worse off than I would be, which is a great reminder to keep things in perspective. 
I would also put a post out on the local Facebook group to find out who would like to come for a walk. (We live very rural so going for a walk is generally a very solitary experience as you may see a car but no other walkers) 
The same Facebook site could be used to offer help to older persons in my community to offer help with shopping etc. These are all measures that help to alleviate feeling disconnected etc.

I know I get motivated by motivated people - no matter how well I know them.  Instead of being the one waiting for someone to touch base with me, I'd make a big effort to reach out.  I'd have to decide whether it's a one or one, or a small group, and then, how would this happen, by txt/phone/zoom.  I decide that a small group would be best (zoom chat) - not so heavy/intimate, but more a ""great to see you all"" environment - as a first step, and perhaps then not the emphasis on my own problems, but finding out what everyone else is up to/feeling. I'd invite a small group, no more than 4 but 3 better (say by FB messenger) e.g. ""just touching base to say hi and see if any of you are up for a zoo catchup chat - maybe 3:00pm on Thursday"" .  Wait for their response, set up the preferred arrangement, and then it's actually me that makes the call when the time came.  Even though the chat might be general, some people may open up and share, who knows where the conversation will head.  Maybe the next day, I would contact just one of the group I felt a stronger connection with.  Send a message ""hey it was great to chat yesterday...perhaps I can call again so we can chat some more - I'd really appreciate that"".  Hopefully the reply would be a positive one...and if not, oh well, at least I tried.  My next effort would be something completely different e.g. a group chat on-line with strangers through a reputable support group.

Whilst it was part of my retirement plan I left behind my family, i.e. my two children, six grandchildren, my mother, inlaws and countless relatives. Yes the thought of moving to the Gold Coast was very exciting, friends and relatives all said that they would stay in contct. Once I settled in I was in a new city in a hugh apartment block no friends and knew nobody and did not hear from the friends I left behind.I started walking around the neighbourhood looking to connect with people, tourist were always willing to have a chat but nothing lasting. Each day I would use the elevators in the building, I started meeting other people who were permenant residents not just tourist. So I started to connect with them and exchanged phone numbers. Soon I started to invite these people to dinner. I soon found out that many had been here for many years and did not know others in the building. I then had an idea to start a social club with the building so other permenant residence could connect with each other. Soon we were playing cards, together, going out to dinner and going to shows. More importantly we started to look after each other. If we were lonely we could call on each other, if we were sick we could help each other, if we needed a helping hand there was always someone there.

I would make contact with them. I would try and remember to keep the conversation going both ways and not make it all about me, this way it would make me feel less alone. 
I could also look for online book clubs or similar that offers a new group of people with similar interests to share ideas and opinions with. 
I would also be careful how much news I watched as it can make you feel worse and more disconnected.

The neighbors talk about their own isolation and decide that they too, might bring out some instruments and play.

I plan to contact two people each day. If I am feeling a little apprehensive I will text rather than ring, as it is easier. Once I have started contacting people I set up regular catch up times, moving from text and emails to phone calls and video chats. Each time I contact a person I commit to catching up with them again at the end of our chat. I ask them to reach out to me if I have not been in touch, explain that I have been feeling isolated and would really appreciate their help. I continue these calls, video chats, texts and emails, and make them part of my regular routine. So that it is no longer awkward or nervewracking to call anyone.

At first I told her I was a bit reluctant to visit because she has Rheumatoid Arthritis and is at a higher risk. She said she was on the anti malaria medication they are trialing as a treatment for COVID 19. I went to visit her and it was great to connect and watch a movie together.  I had message and FaceTime calls with friends and that was a great thing to do. I had started cleaning out my house and simplifying my life, granted I was unable to actually get rid of unwanted things that I couldnâ€™t fit in the bin, but I have pile of things I want to dispose of. I was connecting with my students via Zoom and doing classes for them, that was great because I got to see how they are all going and have a different kind of connection. Then I came up with an idea about a possible way to deliver online content that could be purchased as an add on to regular training when we return to normal life and training again. It was at that time, I received an email from my old business coach. I was undecided at first, but I had an invitation to a free webinar with him, as a way of assisting fitness professionals during COVID 19. I joined the free webinar and got quite a bit from it. I then decided it was in my best interest to pursue the of avenue further development of my idea, as the one thing I did have was time. I Had a private session with him Via zoom and told him about my idea. He thought it was a sound idea, so after some financial consideration by me, I decided to sign up with him again. I am now in the process of working on my idea and have spoken to him a few times, this has given me the opportunity to have more personal interactions. My boss is retiring tomorrow, so we were trying to workout what to do for him, I suggested we do a zoom catch up for drinks. We did that tonight and it was great to catch with my work colleagues and wish my boss the best in his retirement. I am feeling well connected to my family, friends and work colleagues, thanks to messaging, FaceTime and zoom applications.

I start feeling better as we share stories both familiar and new about our lives. When I hang up I am feeling rejuvenated as I have connected with someone outside my immediate family or work colleagues, giving my self an emotional lift.

2. I would make a list of the friends, family or colleagues I could call and first decide who may best benefit by hearing from me and prioritising them.
3. I would start ringing them and 'check in' with how they are doing and finding out a bit about ng their day or week and what's been happening for them.
After connecting with a few of these friends, family or colleagues I realise how much better and happier I feel and resolve to do this more regularly.

I decide that connecting with some friends and family will help me feel better. Due to covid 19 restrictions I can not visit people so I decide to call some people and do a video call too. My sister does not have video call facilities so I decide to call her. She has a new baby so I text her first and organise a time that suits her. I then text my friend and see if she wants to do a video call. We organise a time for that too. While waiting for my catch up times I do some jobs around the house while listening to an audio book or interesting podcast. Just before my first catch up time I make a coffee and get a healthy morning snack ready so I can sit down and chat with my sister. Afterwards I spend time in the garden and cleaning out my animals pens (I have a lot ðŸ˜‚). And then come inside a few minutes before I am due to video call my friend and get a tasty lunch together and spend the next hour chatting and laughing with my friend. I spend the rest of the day feeling happy and connected. I enjoy going for an afternoon walk.

If i were having a particular bad day i may struggle to think of who these people are but fortunately i thought to write a list of the names of â€˜my special peopleâ€™ in the front page of my diary.
So iâ€™d look at that list and get a feeling about who i would like to contact to talk to either over the phone or in person.
Iâ€™d also remind myself not to contact my parents as as much as iâ€™d like to, speaking with them when iâ€™m feeling bad always ends up with me feeling much much worse...even if that seems impossible.
If the first person i choose to call is not available, iâ€™ll call someone else on my list.

I would check my diary for commitments and then make time to call a person on my list. If someone is busy I will reach out via sms to say Hi. If I haven't been able to get in contact and am still feeling quite isolated I will set an alarm on my phone to try to reach out again at a specific time. Then I will check my list of self care options and choose one to do while I wait for someone to be available or contact me back. My go to steps are stimulate my five senses, put on oil burner, make a cup of tea, grab my favourite soft socks for my feet, put on the music chanel and scroll through my pintrest board. 
Something that I have now is contact with a few friends overseas via twitter and Skype, so generally there is someone I can reach out to and connect with at all times.

Itâ€™s hard to feel motivated to do anything but I know that this is not good for me and I try and set aside some time to mull it over - I like solving other peopleâ€™s problems, why am I so resistant to trying to solve my own?

I try to determine when I feel most lonely. Am I thinking about particular things or people at those times? Are there key people or types of people I am particularly missing contact with? 

Come to think of it, are there times I feel more content? What am I doing or thinking in those times? Is there something I enjoy that I might be able to share with other people?

I would like to try and find times I am happier and bring the people I am missing in to experience those with me if possible. Can I reach these people? Do I know anyone that might be able to join me in the things I enjoy?

I should get in touch with some of the people whose company I miss and who make me smile, I might try social media or texts. I have been meaning to try and catch up with people I used to see daily and whose conversation I miss. I see my colleagues in team meetings but that can still be lonely, we are talking as a mass and not as individuals.

I wonder if I should join a group of people who share my hobbies, there seem to be more popping up that invite remote participation and maybe someone can recommend something? Can I engage with people I donâ€™t know yet remotely? Wonâ€™t it be awkward?

The colleague I got in touch with has sent a nice long list of things they think Iâ€™ll enjoy, and has recommended a virtual meet-up group to me. I am not looking forward to the first virtual event with people I donâ€™t know but I agree to join anyway. 

These new people are great and Iâ€™m enjoying getting to know my colleague better outside work as well. I leave the first session with a big smile and tell my partner all about the new friends Iâ€™m making.

I pass the word on to other colleagues in our next team catch up; that Iâ€™ve joined a new group and made some new acquaintances who share similar interests. I feel that I have more people to talk with and Iâ€™ve also encouraged others to try something similar.

Although I still miss my volunteers roll I am busy with learning how to bake different types of sourdough breads. I am looking forward to seeing and being a part of volunteers services again. 

I am looking forward to seeing my friends and having a coffee. I am also looking forward to get back to the choirs I sing in.

I do feel somewhat feel connected with one choir as we sing together on zoom. I always look forward to Monday. 

I keep myself happy and glass full by keeping in contact with family and friends by phone or Facebook and Instagram. 

I always bake to much for my family and gift sourdough to my choir family or my volunteers family or friends and neighbours. I am looking forward to sharing my newly learned versions ie ciabatta, baguettes, whole wheat, focaccia, cinnamon rolls etc.

I feel lucky that my 3 children still live at home so my husband and I have a full house regardless of COVID-19. Our house is always busy.

Even pre-Covid found that the couples tended not to mix with the singles/widows.  So we set up our own group, a monthly breakfast where we planned activities/outings for the month.  Also started a cards group and mah jong.  All these stopped with social distancing.  I had also set up a community website, from which I resigned following some family trauma elsewhere and personality clashes here (I call them the Bossy Old Men Brigade (BOMB) who are irritated by intelligent women, but in all honesty I am prickly too.  So I sent in some ideas how we could really use the website (online competitions, mutual help pages, all the usual) and offered to come back in as a 'gopher' to help. All accepted gratefully except the head BOMB who was nasty and so was his wife.  Plus my UK son is doing it hard post cancer, locked up at home with wife and 4 kids, relationship in trouble and typical 40+ male won't talk about it.
So I nosedived, and felt very isolated and lonely.  And lost a much loved person in the UK to covid over Easter;  he was a kind of 'big brother' to me when i was younger.  Ho - bottom of the treacle well.
BUT all was not lost - I was lucky to have two singles living close to me, who knew and they reached out to me.  I as usual was prickly and didn't want help but they pushed.  
And shared their problems.  That was a key point -- we all 3 have difficult adult sons, and problems which were surprisingly similar.  So we fell into the habit of chatting regularly, and of course in such a community we meet on the street.  Then we set up a weekly card game.  I responded to a community callout to help those who needed it (eg a new single home owner, social isolation and has no car!) to offer to help, eg shopping, etc.  Or computer help as I'm quite good at that.
So, it was a question of opening up to other people, admitting my own difficulties,  being truthful and less prickly and self absorbed.  I am not alone in this, but also need to learn not to go overboard and offer more than I am really willing to give on a regular basis - it's OK to set boundaries.  Also, I have a Jack Russell terrier who needs exercising, I cannot walk far so I use a mobility scooter.  Just going up and down the streets and into the green spaces I see / talk to others every day and it helps.  I feel better, and I managed to get on top of a couple of tasks that had been hanging over me.  But the best of all is what follows:
I received an anonymous card in my (community) mailbox. with a pic of a koala.  The message read:
Hi Gina,  Hope you like this card.  It's to let you know that you are cared about very much.  I love to see you ride past on your scooter with a smile always on your face.  It's been a very sad time for you just lately, but I'm hoping you feel better soon.  You have friends who care.  x  x  x 
I checked all the usual suspects who all hotly denied it, and my widow friend over the road remarked 'if it was anonymous the person wants to be anonymous - stop hunting it down and just accept the kindness'.  Sage advice.
So now I feel better, more able to tackle tasks, and more accepting of my own shortcomings.  We so often hound ourselves for our failures and downplay our good bits.  I'm not so bad after all.",JS,,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,0,13/05/2020 18:20,100,True,1565,R_6u88fHUIpImuvUR,I CONSENT to participation in this research study.,72.0,Female,,Yes,QLD,Yes - past,Bachelor University Degree(s),Retired,,,Northern/Western European,,Yes - with mild core activity limitation,More than 30 days,55.0,Slightly negative impact,None,None,None,None,Dog(s),Very,Moderate risk,Moderate risk,Moderate risk,High risk,High risk,2020-05-14 19:56:00,103.109.132.140,100.0,R_1RNKHHOQmoNJpER,0.0,,,41.0,ginasalier@yahoo.com.au,6.0,8.0,31.0,2.0,63.0,2.0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I knew only 3 people here and one of them very close. 
My new place needs some renovations so I got that started and it is still ongoing so I get to chat with the tradespeople every day, and on the odd occasion we share a beer on Friday afternoon.
I contacted my two friends living here and one of them we went on walks together which has been great to learn about my new place.
My other friend I visit and take coffee as he is incapacitated at the moment waiting for an operation  and I just check in on him as well through the phone.
My friends I left behind we are in regular contact by phone and my brother and daughter/son-in-law who all live overseas regularly contact me via what's app or face time, and we share photos - me of the renos and my brother of his new grandaughter and my daughter of her travels and location.
I have joined a volunteer group to help support vulnerable people.
And today I met a man on my walk who is a historian and gave me his card with a website on to find out about my new place.
I have met my  neighbour across the road and chat with him when I see him outside his place.
My very close friend I see regularly which means we have to break the distance travelled rules but that changes this weekend - we have both been distancing with others, but she has been my real feeling of connection and support as well as my daughter and brother.

Everyone is probably enjoying themselves much more than me, I am not sure I am even worthy to bother anyone right now. I feel alone and feel like the lonliest person in the world.

Shouldn't i? Ugh, what should i do, maybe i wont bother. I change my mind and  get the number but feel very nervous and totally anxious in case i am rejected by her, we just lost contact when I got married.  I draft up an sms and read it, read it again. I run through all the memories i shared with this person in my head, i wish i never lost contact with her but she too never contacted me, I wonder if she is alone or lonely, how is she? is she happy? How would she re-act to my sms. Well. I decided to click the button and send the message... 1 hour goes by, 2 hours go by and then A MESSAGE came back (all while i couldn't breath as i was so nervous i wouldn't get a response) she replied and also states she has many fond memories of our freindship!

This would have different categories: 1) my wife and child (but I would worry about putting too much pressure on my child, so I would really reach out to my wife and try to enjoy my child more 2) my sister and mother who live interstate 3) my close friends, many of whom also live interstate 4) my colleagues and co-workers.
For feeling isolated and lonely I would already think I am spending time with my wife, but I would talk to her about it, and about my need to reach out to others.
I would reach out by telephone/facetime and email to my sister and mother. I would call my mother more regularly, perhaps even daily for a while, just to say hi and check in.
Then, I would think through about my close friends who live interstate and think, who is the best to talk to in this situation. So I would think about who is most likely to be sympathetic, but also who might have time (eg do they have young kids), and I would reach out first by text message to arrange a time to chat. Then I would call them and have chats. I have, in fact, been doing exactly this over the last two months, reaching out to good friends but people who I don't see regularly because we don't even live in the same city. And there are two in particular who I can talk to about my feelings, even if I'm feeling bad. So we would talk about our jobs, but also about our feelings.
Then I would see if I could work out justifiable reasons to be able to go in to work occasionally, where even though there are not a lot of people around (because almost everyone is working from home), you can still get to see people face to face, albeit at a distance. Again, I have done this in the last two months because I have been having computer problems. So I would take my home computer in to work to get fixed, then bring home a work computer. But this would give me a reason to spend the whole day at work - my day is so full of meetings, etc, that there's not really enough time to commute in the middle of the day and still attend all my meetings effectively. So, once I go in to work for the day I usually stay for the whole day. And when I do that, I often reach out to the colleagues with whom I get on well, and who I know 1 also go in, to see if we can go in on the same days. And if that happens, then we go for a walk together or have lunch together (across a big desk), so we are still maintaining social distancing but we are also making face to face contact.
Also, I call colleagues on the mobile more often than I used to. So part of the plan involves asking people via email for their mobile phone numbers, and then ringing them rather than sending an email. It is often easier to talk things through on the phone, and you can get more done so it works better for complex communication anyway, but the bonus is that I get to talk to more people.

I would group the list into people I can phone or video chat with, people I can text and people I can email. I would start by texting a few people on my â€˜text listâ€™, just to say that was thinking of them and was hoping they were doing okay. I would do this first as it would give me a feeling of achievement and wouldnâ€™t dig too deep into my feelings of loneliness and isolation. Doing something simple like this usually puts me in a more positive frame of mind and I would then be able to move on to a deeper level of contact. I would choose an email contact to whom I can â€˜talkâ€™ about deeper matters (eg an overseas relative who has been through self isolation) and ask them about their experience and how they managed feelings of isolation and loneliness. I would also share some of my experiences - both good and not so good - of self isolation.

I would check my inbox, have breaky with my hubby and enjoy the calming effects of living by the sea. 
Then Iâ€™d sift through my mind what jobs/errands I need to do today.... being retired, everyday is fairly flexible on what I get up to. My husband had written 6 books so he happily keeps himself busy in his office and we enjoy coffee/tea breaks today along with our meals.
I see I have a dentist appointment so I call my mum and ask if I can get them any groceries as Woolworths is right next door to the dentist. Keeping busy keeps negative thoughts away. 1 I donâ€™t know why I feel down, maybe I didnâ€™t sleep well or Iâ€™m sad about a problem on of our kids are experiencing. Our combined 6 kids are all independent and we have 8 grandkids tho none live close with the majority of the family living a 19-12hr drive away. I donâ€™t do a video call as I feel itâ€™s best not to do so if Iâ€™m feeling low. However doing some housework, connecting with others online make that fade into the distance. I go to the dentist and enjoy the catch up there. I grab groceries for my parents and drop inside their door then chat to them from the outside for a short while. Seeing if there is anything they need. Mum is 81 and Dad 89. They live in a retirement village. 
I head home and pull the washing off and think about dinner. Hubby asks me to walk with him and when we return home, Iâ€™ve found it really enjoyed it esp as I missed my morning walk. We sit on the balcony and enjoy a sundowner together as the sun sets. Afterwards we have dinner and settle down to watch a movie together. In bed we each read for awhile. Over the day, my mood has lifted and Iâ€™m back to normal again. Sleep comes easily.

I would check where my meetings and emails afforded a block amount of time to get the job done as I am working full time from home [Time management].
I would also identify if anyone else is in the house who has been responsible for making/leaving the mess (e.g. teenage kids).  I would ask those responsible to come and clean up their mess [delegation and resource allocation].  This is likely to take 3 - 5 repeated requests, moving into ""putting my foot down"" instructions to get those responsible to get into the kitchen and clean up their mess [performance management].

If he was busy with work, I would contact my sister and see if she fancies a chat (she lives in the USA so the time difference matters). We donâ€™t have a lot in common (never have) but we are frank and open with each other. She is alone at home so I know that she is usually available. It surprises and irritates me that she doesnâ€™t call me, instead she sends lots of annoying social media posts or funny GIFs. I think thatâ€™s her way of reaching out to say hello. Her excuse is she doesnâ€™t know if Iâ€™m available and that makes me feel vexed.
If the time difference was wrong or if I still felt lonely after the call with her, I would try to phone some of my close friends.
If nobody answered my call I would send a message and hope that one of them was able to get back to me later on.
If I really wanted to reach out I would write an email to a range of people (family and friends) asking about everyday things or I might post something on social media and see who responds. This is rarely an option to improve a sense of loneliness for me. I read comments on social media posts and think how shallow people are. If I thought someone was reaching out I would call them and not ðŸ‘ or â¤ï¸ them. Makes me sad that our method of communicating with each other has been reduced to this drivel.
If I really wanted to connect with someone I would invite them around for a cup of tea or now we can have friends over for dinner.

I would then decide whether to call, text, email or visit and what time.

I decided to text her first so that I wouldn't disturb her or make her feel uncomfortable about my approach to her and then wait for her reaction before making a further suggestion of keeping in touch with her. She seemed happy about the idea of meeting up in a local park with a takeaway coffee for a chat, of course being very aware of the current social distancing requirements.
So we met at the appointed time and place and I was pleasantly surprised to meet by chance another friend who live close by and we invited her to join us as well.

2. Write down my goal somewhere. Maybe on my PC screen (e-post-it). At the very least a post-it note the sticks to the PC itself but maybe an A4 or a Word document that I can open up and add to about how I am progressing vs. the goal.
3. Write down some of the thing I have tried in the past in a list and determine whether they are appropriate now. 
4. Google the goal. Get some ideas from the net. Write down in a word doc or on paper the ones I think are either or both interesting or achievable. Rank them by both 'Optimyum to achieve the goal and ""I could do these successfully' as opposed to 'the idea is interesting but don't think I want to do that'
5. Select 3-5 ideas of the 'top ranking' ideas to do over the next 1-2 weeks. 
6. Set an incentive - e.g. a DVD I've wanted or sports clothing or even a new electronic gadget - along with a specific outcome (eg I will have tried 3 out ion the 5 ideas for a minimum of 1-2 hours)
6.Select 1 thing to do TODAY. Small / Easy thing to do. A 'SMART (Specific, Achievable. Time-bound etc)' goal. Do it today with a self-reward (chocolate bar) or tomorrow and no reward. This sets an immediate incentive.
7. Don't move forward with any other actions until completed and assessed how I did. If it didn't work, put it in the 'Too Hard' basket or 'Try again later'. It's OK to fail. It's not OK not to try at least a bit...
8. Work though the list, one at a time until some achievement towards the goal. Write up achievements and note failures and what I'm doing wrong. 
9. If possible check with someone trusted/close/non-judgemental how I'm doing... even the doctor if no-one else.
Many of the actions will be easy; e.g. reaching out to peopIe haven't connected to a while, volunteering at an organisation once a mont; taking the dog to the dog park; trying to connect with a busy neighbour; joining a running group (I've almost always been a solo runner)... the greatest challenge is to take action and then evaluate and learn...

Decide what to do, such as help a neighbour with mowing or meals on wheels or driving a neighbour to shops etc.
Let's do mowing which is one I currently do.
I saw neighbour struggling with the mowing of her long grass - her husband is not interested in helping out much around the house. 
I offered one day to run the mower over lawn when I was doing mine, and she was happy that I offered, and have been helping out since then - about 18 months.

Iâ€™d then take my breakfast ( favourite meal of the day ) out onto the deck and mindfully enjoy it, perhaps whilst working on a crossword.
Next I would text a couple of my friends to see if anyone is free for a socially distant takeaway coffee catch up. Even if no one was free, I would still dress up a bit and go to one of the local coffee shops to grab a takeaway coffee for myself, returning to the deck to check my emails. 
If there are any from friends, I will enjoy my cuppa, pop the radio on and type away some replies. Or I may have â€˜virtualâ€™ coffee catch ups with a friend who is able to face time with me in my garden swing chair ( where my cat will often join me ).
Hearing about the lives - joys and struggles - of close friends whilst distancing usually makes me feel inspired, particularly if weâ€™ve shared a recipe of like to try or a place they may have driven to or a new hobby theyâ€™ve discovered that may remind me of an old hobby Iâ€™d like to revisit.

I generally connect with people via the phone. I could look through my list of contacts, to see if there are friends that I have not spoken to in a while. I might start by using SMS or a messaging app, as that feels easier.

Often when calling people, they are not answering, but I generally donâ€™t leave messages because no one listens to them anyway. They will see a missed call if they could not answer.

If I still feel lonely/isolated I then look at how I can change the house to symbolise welcoming others such as leaving doors/windows open, putting out fresh flowers, putting on makeup etc. I then go for a walk and say hello to those I pass.

Who am I actually in contact with and how often do I communicate with them either face to face or via technology. Am I alone, what is â€˜aloneâ€™ anyway, if I can listen to the radio or read books written by amazing people. 
Next step, if there seems like thereâ€™s some obvious room for improvement like I could get out my phone list and lost six people who I might ring up, or decide to make more time to just be together with my husband and daughter, decide to have these conversations. If the first steps in solving this problem are about reality checking, it couldâ€™ve that Iâ€™m feeling lonely even though there are people around me. My dad always said: if you donâ€™t like the way the world is, change the world , or change the way you look at it. When a problem is a â€˜feelingâ€™ often the way to change your feeling is to change the way you look at it.

LIST: 
1. Make a concerted effort to contact my old friends Jane, Vicky, Anita, Sally, Rosemary, Linda, Richard, Georgie, Bridget, Shaz, Anya via phone,  text, email or skype. 
Firstly make a list of my friends - Type a generic email and alter for each individual putting in personal touches. Wait for replies and continue regular correspondence in the future. Send a text to make a time to call. (I feel I am quite lazy when it comes to keeping in contact with friends and I'm not surprised that I have few friends close by.) 
2. Learn conversational Spanish. Go through all my learn Spanish material. Do minimum 30 minutes practice daily. Enrol in a Spanish TAFE course when it opens again. Find free Spanish conversation possibilities via the internet This will help me feel more connected when I (hopefully) return to Spain for a holiday next year 
3. Start a small business selling propagated plants. 
Firsly, buy little pots and potting mix. Pot baby plants and ask my daughter to photograph these and more mature plants. Ask her to help me to set up a website to advertise and market them on the internet. I would get a lot of satisfaction earning money from my own venture rather than relying on my husband.This activity will involve valuable and mentally active time spent with my daughter and make some extra cash
4. Enrol in the lifeline telephone counselling course. Call the local lifeline centre for information regarding training. If it's within my budget, commence training and I will be able to assist needy people with advice and feel connected with other counsellors. I feel I have a good deal of life experience and plenty of free time to give back to the community
5. Enrol in an art course. (Before Covid-19 I had joined one group and started to make friends but left as it was too costly)
Contact the Queensland arts centre to join and attend Friday $5 sessions if they are still on. I love painting, learning new techniques and being with like-minded people.

I'd like to feel more connected with others, which would mean spending time with them either face to face or via some other medium. There is no-one in the small town I live in I can connect to (music or yoga group) due to current restrictions, so it will have to be someone away from here. I get on well with my niece, but she is having exams and assessments at the moment, so is time-poor. I have another Aspie friend in another state - I haven't talked to her for a while, so I will text her and see if she has time to talk.

As there are 5 days a week that we hardly step outside the house or see anyone else, other than the pets.
In a desperate need to feel more connected to other people I have arranged to walk past my neighbours house at a time she is home and we will have a chat over the fence with her and her kids.  This will allow for social interaction as well as exercise.  In the afternoon I have arranged a Skype chat with my Mum and Dad, followed by one with my partner just before bed time and after dinner.

I am not allowed to go to the usual places where I would congregate with people and have the opportunity to make new friends, for example the office, the gym, music venues, cultural events. In order to create connection I need to:
1. Wait until the world opens up again and the government deems it legal to visit a bar/club/restaurant etc.
2. Sign up to some classes
3. Find an effective volunteering option that's not already horrendously oversubscribed
4. Go out more, strike up conversations, be more gregarious.

Initially, when the thought popped into my mind I chuckled and thought, â€œthe human centipede is fucking grossâ€. When I more seriously contemplated this, an image of my son came to mind. Ideally he would be laughing as we played a game or asleep in his cot.  What was actI ally happening was that my toddler was throwing a next-level hissy-fit in the room next door. His mum, my wife, was trying to calm him. Sheâ€™s much better at that than I. I give them both a hug, my son pretends to throw fire at me, yelling, â€œyes mateâ€ and â€œwhackadooâ€. The kid watches too much Bluey. I feel a bit better. Later that evening, I chill out Playing video games listening to a slow, sad song and a couple of beers. Itâ€™s not connecting per se, but it helps to recharge the batteries- I see a lot of people in my job and some time a lone is important as I often feel drained by the end of the week. Itâ€™s hard to get time to yourself with so many other people in your life. I feel lucky, I know weâ€™ve - so far - dodged the Covid bullet. I might also call a friend through discord and weâ€™ll play a game together. When I tire of games, or if itâ€™s getting late, Iâ€™ll go to the living room, make my wife a Milo and maybe give her a backrub. I worry about her, despite having more friends than me she doesnâ€™t get out like I do and isnâ€™t as easygoing. Her job is also less secure. Nevertheless, if weâ€™ve had a good day and weâ€™re not too tired, we have sex. Later, when we go to bed we lie next to one another. I feel connected.

I would then firstly go through my phone. Through the contacts list first. I would look through the list of people and note down those names of people that, for no apparent reason, we had drifted apart.
Some i know have not been contacted for over 2 years.
I know that it would bring up memories, some good, some not so much maybe.
And then, of course go through the list i had just made decide who i would love to speak to. An 'old friend' not acquaintance. Someone who or some inexplicable reason had drifted or gradually petered out, or just one day stopped writing , texting, or calling.
I would know how such a call from me, out of the blue, would please some, astonish some,be welcomed by some, ignored by some or possibly ignored by some, blocked , maybe, by some.
Then, I would, feeling happy, confident and ready to hear their voice again call them.
Shivers of nervous energy cascading like waves, i would encounter as it rang, and rang and then finally the familiar voice, probably saying ""OMG, Hello"". 
I'd feel my body relax, strengthen and the finally say
""Ya know what, you are such a little f****r. What, I suddenly became superfluous, you dropped your phone down the loo ? 
Or still just a complete dick for not even bothering to call me after all the help and time i spent on you. 
Not to mention everything else you drained me off. So as we all have extra time at the moment to think and remember, I thought I would take ths opportinity to tell you, 'Congratulation. You've won 'The Co-Vid 19 Award for 2020'. It is awarded to the person that has the most things in common with the Corona Virus. And you my friend appear to have an endless list of similarities.
To name a few: 
1 You cause more dramas than the virus
2 You make more people sick, by being you than the virus
3 You are less welcome in homes, than the virus
4 You made the curve currently attempting to be straightend
5 Nobody survives in tact meeting or knowing you

The simply say   ""HAPPY CO-VID""

Ps: To Much Info ? or should i stress more examples
Oh I would be on cloud 9 after that

Though there are many Virtual Choirs popping up, I am not very keen on joining any. Recording myself singing something which would then be seen on YouTube is not appealing.
Several other members might go this way but others are like me.

I would contact them and see if between us we could do some research.
Hopefully we might discover other Choirs online which are rehearsing some of the music we enjoy but without the need to record oneself singing.
We would pool our information and  let everyone else know which options we had found.
The end result might be that we each try various options and keep in contact with the others with results, opinions, suggestions until we can meet and sing again together.

Although I visit them regularly as the houses are only separated by a breezeway, I realise they have their own life and come and go mostly separate to me.
When they go out I really feel isolated and lonely not knowing what is going on. I have previously set up a family facebook page but I am the main one to post on there. Realising my family are busy with their own lives I decide to email/ text my brothers individually to ask them how they are going. I requested one of my brothers to call in to see me on his way home from work. I also decide to text some friends to check in with them to see how they are going. I also purchased some items to send to other members of my family. These steps started conversations with family and friends and resulted in some visits and replies to my texts.

[2] then acknowledging  that I am the answer to resolving this situation ... it isn't reasonable to expect others to ""know"" how I am unless I share this with them.. and I need to ensure they , and I, don't see me as a victim.
[3]what I need is connection ... to feel heard and listened to by others .... understanding too that they may need exactly the same ..
[4] write a list of people I could call ....accepting that when I call they may not be able to speak at that moment... and that I shouldn't allow myself to become disheartened by that.But make another time
[5]Create the List ... my 94 year old Aunt Pam ..siblings,brother Peter , sisters Jen, Jo and Deb....also  my daughter Amanda, male friends....Alex  [probably a socially distanced coffee in a park], Peter M, Peter G, Paul M, Gaz ,Gary C,Ian L .. arrange lunch with my daughter Jamison .
[6] make a call........ Pam first, then  Jen,  next Jamison for a lunch... Gaz
[7] the first call with Pam is a delight , she is excited and delighted to hear from me , ""You've made my day Hunter"" .I always feel so up lifted by my calls with her , and then Jen , again an up lifting and heartfelt call. I'm so encouraged I phone Jamison and we arrange lunch the following day.

I would identify my feelings with compassion and think about how best to manage them, bearing in mind what has worked for me in the past.  I need a structure and strategy not to cave in to feelings of loneliness and isolation and despair..  I would also reassure myself I have my weekly appointment with my therapist which is my safety net.  Food is important too.  I know how it affects my mood so I would make sure I eat the right things to help me feel stable and donâ€™t become too hungry.
I know that my yoga practice improves my mood, calms me, increases my creativity and energy levels so I would do that first.  It sets the scales for the day. Then Iâ€™d be ready to engage with my art practice hopefully losing myself in its flow listening to the radio or music that feels right.  I know itâ€™s important not to get overtired so I would try to pace myself.  Overdoing is as bad as not doing enough.

From constantly feeling down and blue, unmotivated and thinking whats the point, waking up and facing another day, just like every other day, this is a huge ordeal. Procrastination has become a new problem and with no motivation I literally have to fight the demons to make this happen. 

From choosing what to wear, putting on makeup and doing my hair, (to look human in public!) takes quite a lot of effort and time, way more than it should but feel its worth it because it gives me confidence in public and I feel that if I give the impression that if I'm still put together in appearance then it hides whats going on inside.

After walking around in circles for too long than I feel comfortable with, I make myself leave the house and walk down to the local shops. I feel anxious and kind of afraid for some reason.

Once I have talked to a couple of shopkeepers and a couple of random strangers on the way I'm starting to feel a lot better. My mind is otherwise occupied while engaging with people so the angst is kept at bay during this time.

When I return home I felt great about making myself get out and about and feel connected with people and not so isolated and lonely.

Everything on radio, TV from the PM's addresses spoke about families during the pandemic.
To feel less isolated and alone I knew I would need to 'see and talk to people'.
Initially I thought I would escape to Melbourne to be with my sister and her partner if we were going into a lockdown. I left my running to late. ( Probably a good thing as I would have out stayed my welcome by now!)
Fast forward until now and if I am feeling isolated I know I can, text and see if a friend wants to come for a walk either in a park or around the local streets. It's great if a friend can join me. 
I also would text to see if a friend would like to come over for lunch or afternoon tea. I would plan something to make and look forward to their company. Doing this makes me feel connected. 
If I'm not able to meet up with a friend I would call or text a friend to have a chat.
I have a few friends I 'see and chat' to each week on either through Zoom, Facetime or Messenger.

Depending on how that conversation goes I would send a follow up text within the next couple of day.
 I know I can't rely on just communicating with one person. I would  keep myself involved with my friendship groups by I texting them and  asking how they are and sending them an update on what I've been doing, reading &/ watching. I would pick a common interest- eg send photos of grandchildren doing something cute, photo of flowering shrub or produce from my vegetable garden.
This usually leads to a text dialogue over a couple of days.
I would also practice mindfulness and follow a prepared format like Buddify rather than do it independently to stop my mind from wandering.

I would firstly start with getting to know people in our street. I would smile, say hello and make introductions. I would share some information about us and ask questions of others so that I could start building a relationship with our neighbours. I would offer children in the street to play cricket with our children on the street, I would get to know the parents of children and invite them to our house if they would like to have a swim in the pool or to play. I have walked our dogs to many parks and met some nice dog owners nearby. I have joined a gym and have participated in events offered such as bush walks and picnics so I can get to know other members and the staff better. I have stayed in touch with friends and family in Victoria via phone, video, social media and text/email. I have volunteered at our sons' football club and got to know coaching staff and other parents. I have met parents at our sons' school and my husband and I have been to a parent event to meet others. I have also met many of my husband's work colleagues. My nephew is now staying with us and we have been going away together on weekends (whilst travel restrictions have eased) so we can enjoy the beautiful Queensland environment. Last weekend we met up with some old friends of over 12 years. I feel more connected and closer to people since arriving in January, despite being socially distanced for the past 9+ weeks.

I am really enjoying the quiet and space that Covid has given me.  I only really miss seeing my sister and family and our brand new grand-child and my oldest friend whose daughter is waiting for a double transplant and who she sees 4 days a week to look after, so I am really scared of going anywhere near either group.  Other than that I am blessed to have friends who care and we keep in touch by phone or text.
Itâ€™s very hard to imagine what I would do in your scenario because it implies someone having no-one to care about them which is awful.  

If there really were no family or friends, I guess I would reach out to some of the amazing services like Lifeline or Beyond Blue and hopefully get support and ideas from them.  I would try and interact more with neighbours and see if there was anyone in my area that I could help ... you get back so much more than you give when times are tough (and any time really).  Offering to help through volunteering can introduce you to all sorts of people who would love to keep in touch and hopefully make your loneliness and isolation a thing of the past.

Become philosophical and decide to give to community where I can while still maintaining Social Distance to protect myself and others. Ring old friends, Sign up for Facebook, bake cakes for previous Medical Centre workplace, grow vegetables and herbs, and give excess to friends and neighbours. Been very busy all my life as an RN. This has taught me to slow down and smell the Roses. Getting immense pleasure from giving keeps my spirit soaring. There is deeper compassion for countries not as fortunate as us also , with death death tolls and questionable leadership.This story is an ending , not how how I imagine it would be. ",Medium

First I would make a list of family, friends and neighbours whom I can contact via phone, video and/or email. 
Secondly look online for people in my neighbourhood who have groups that meet online with similar interests. e.g. bookclub, gardening enthusiasts. 
Third I would increase my activity on social networking siteâ€™s  - Facebook, instagram 
I start with phone calls to family and friends because these people are in my comfort zone. 
Then I would do some research online to see what type of groups etc are out there. What their rules are. What age group theyâ€™re targeting. Decide if I want to join a closed group or public. 
After collating what I have found make a decision. Maybe ask to join them all. Or select one to two I like the most and will be actively interested in what is being talked about.
And the third part of the plan while online Facebook and Instagram. Update these accounts. Add something new, daily on both. Check my settings see who can see my feed. Open it up to family and friends. Add new groups, interests. 
Once I began these ideas would just keep flowing. I would feel incredible. I would not be lonely. I may be in isolation for my safety, I now realise Iâ€™m not isolated. I may also be even helping others who feel as I did, lonely and isolated by reaching out and connecting. WOW, I feel great!!  ",High

781,"I live in a gated ""50+"" community, independent living (ie NOT retirement village).  Even pre-Covid found that the couples tended not to mix with the singles/widows.  So we set up our own group, a monthly breakfast where we planned activities/outings for the month.  Also started a cards group and mah jong.  All these stopped with social distancing.  I had also set up a community website, from which I resigned following some family trauma elsewhere and personality clashes here (I call them the Bossy Old Men Brigade (BOMB) who are irritated by intelligent women, but in all honesty I am prickly too.  So I sent in some ideas how we could really use the website (online competitions, mutual help pages, all the usual) and offered to come back in as a 'gopher' to help. All accepted gratefully except the head BOMB who was nasty and so was his wife.  Plus my UK son is doing it hard post cancer, locked up at home with wife and 4 kids, relationship in trouble and typical 40+ male won't talk about it.
So I nosedived, and felt very isolated and lonely.  And lost a much loved person in the UK to covid over Easter;  he was a kind of 'big brother' to me when i was younger.  Ho - bottom of the treacle well.
BUT all was not lost - I was lucky to have two singles living close to me, who knew and they reached out to me.  I as usual was prickly and didn't want help but they pushed.  
And shared their problems.  That was a key point -- we all 3 have difficult adult sons, and problems which were surprisingly similar.  So we fell into the habit of chatting regularly, and of course in such a community we meet on the street.  Then we set up a weekly card game.  I responded to a community callout to help those who needed it (eg a new single home owner, social isolation and has no car!) to offer to help, eg shopping, etc.  Or computer help as I'm quite good at that.
So, it was a question of opening up to other people, admitting my own difficulties,  being truthful and less prickly and self absorbed.  I am not alone in this, but also need to learn not to go overboard and offer more than I am really willing to give on a regular basis - it's OK to set boundaries.  Also, I have a Jack Russell terrier who needs exercising, I cannot walk far so I use a mobility scooter.  Just going up and down the streets and into the green spaces I see / talk to others every day and it helps.  I feel better, and I managed to get on top of a couple of tasks that had been hanging over me.  But the best of all is what follows:
I received an anonymous card in my (community) mailbox. with a pic of a koala.  The message read:
Hi Gina,  Hope you like this card.  It's to let you know that you are cared about very much.  I love to see you ride past on your scooter with a smile always on your face.  It's been a very sad time for you just lately, but I'm hoping you feel better soon.  You have friends who care.  x  x  x 
I checked all the usual suspects who all hotly denied it, and my widow friend over the road remarked 'if it was anonymous the person wants to be anonymous - stop hunting it down and just accept the kindness'.  Sage advice.
So now I feel better, more able to tackle tasks, and more accepting of my own shortcomings.  We so often hound ourselves for our failures and downplay our good bits.  I'm not so bad after all.",High

I would then suggest that we might meet to go for some exercise (in a socially isolating appropriate way).  That might help us both.  Also whether there is anything else.  Meet up for a walk somewhere different for us both to get out a bit more to see something different.

Suggest we grab a coffee while on the walk and then make time to maybe catch up again in the following week.  ",Medium

Husband who is getting much slower at doing tasks around the house and not as quick at problem solving and organising tasks. Quite sensitive issues.  Feeling a don't want to betray his trust.

- played games on Zoom with my nieces and nephews

- started a new Zoom meeting with Facebook friends I had never met but knew well 
- wrote postcards to my nieces and nephews

Some i know have not been contacted for over 2 years.
I know that it would bring up memories, some good, some not so much maybe.
And then, of course go through the list i had just made decide who i would love to speak to. An 'old friend' not acquaintance. Someone who or some inexplicable reason had drifted or gradually petered out, or just one day stopped writing , texting, or calling.
I would know how such a call from me, out of the blue, would please some, astonish some,be welcomed by some, ignored by some or possibly ignored by some, blocked , maybe, by some.
Then, I would, feeling happy, confident and ready to hear their voice again call them.
Shivers of nervous energy cascading like waves, i would encounter as it rang, and rang and then finally the familiar voice, probably saying ""OMG, Hello"". 
I'd feel my body relax, strengthen and the finally say
""Ya know what, you are such a little f****r. What, I suddenly became superfluous, you dropped your phone down the loo ? 
Or still just a complete dick for not even bothering to call me after all the help and time i spent on you. 
Not to mention everything else you drained me off. So as we all have extra time at the moment to think and remember, I thought I would take ths opportinity to tell you, 'Congratulation. You've won 'The Co-Vid 19 Award for 2020'. It is awarded to the person that has the most things in common with the Corona Virus. And you my friend appear to have an endless list of similarities.
To name a few: 
1 You cause more dramas than the virus
2 You make more people sick, by being you than the virus
3 You are less welcome in homes, than the virus
4 You made the curve currently attempting to be straightend
5 Nobody survives in tact meeting or knowing you

If they don't answer the phone I will leave a voicemail if possible saying 'Just wanted to call and see how you are going'. If I don't hear back from them I will send a text, email or write a letter. I will remind myself that people are busy and if I don't hear back from them quickly I need to be patient. If one of the three responds quite quickly or I manage to talk to someone on the original phone call I will feel more connected and also happy that I may have provided a sense of connection for that person as well.",Medium
111,Iâ€™ll call my best friend and will have a long chat with her. Iâ€™ll look into ideas about how can use social media to get connected to other people. One idea can be to join existing groups on Facebook or make my own friends group on whatâ€™s app to share our ideas such as some new dish or some craft activity. Iâ€™ll take my kids for a walk so we can enjoy nature and connect with each other. Iâ€™ll video call my mum to make sure she is doing fine.

I would think about my family and friendship group. If there is someone who's wellbeing I am concerned about I would plan to ring them.

Depending on how that conversation goes I would send a follow up text within the next couple of day.
 I know I can't rely on just communicating with one person. I would  keep myself involved with my friendship groups by I texting them and  asking how they are and sending them an update on what I've been doing, reading &/ watching. I would pick a common interest- eg send photos of grandchildren doing something cute, photo of flowering shrub or produce from my vegetable garden.
This usually leads to a text dialogue over a couple of days.

My family are more likely to return my calls but I feel closer to friends who live a long way away. Often, I haven't contacted them apart from the odd Christmas card but now I have the time to see how they are coping. This has renewed old friendships and makes me feel my time has been well spent.
With regard to groups I belong to, I have started a private Facebook page for our Writers Group. We normally meet once a month and submit 'homework' - a short story, which is critiqued by others. The Facebook page offers the opportunity for our members to read each other's stories and comment on them. I am about to suggest Zoom as a more intimate face to face meeting. I'm not sure how this will work as most of my group are not au fait with this technology. It would be an interesting exercise to help them learn something new.

242,"Feeling alone in the World is complex to me. A large part of it is physical connection. I am very visceral, I like to express myself through touch and emotion. But for me, to have a true connection, there is always that something more, something extra, that you feel with certain people. When you know, you just know. Some people just exist on that same wavelength as you.

I rarely feel like I even belong on this World. For the longest time in my life I felt alone and isolated simply because I did not feel understood or even heard. These days my words seem to carry more weight than ever before; even more than I would like 1. Amazingly, the feeling of emptiness and loneliness has vastly improved since the lock down. I have managed to actually reconnect with almost everyone important in my life now. Maybe this is because everyone was forced to slow down and actually had the the time to. Or maybe it was the lack of pressure to be productive that gave me the energy to do it. 
Either way, I don't feel as lonely or isolated, but I still feel like something is really missing. 
I have that extra connection with these people but i don't have that physical aspect. I need the companionship to complete me. I want someone to be there for me, support me in what I do and stand by my side when things get tough and truly work for us to be the best we can be, together. Just hold me when I need to cry, squeeze my hand just because they like the feeling of it. I want someone who will love and devote them self to me as much as I would to them. 
I know its not me against the World anymore, if anything I have the support of the World behind me. But i still want that partner in crime, that ride or die, the girl of my dreams. 
And I have found her. I just don't know how it will happen. In my dreams I just receive a card in the mail, or under my door, by the powers that be. All it says on it is her name, on the back is where I need to be and what time. I think i'm going crazy but I take the leap of faith anyway; I buy the most amazing flowers I can find and I just go and wait. I desperately hope this isn't some cruel prank. But its worth the risk of embarrassment because I've been searching for her all my life. I want to believe in miracles. 
And then it happens. She appears. It'll be awkward because we only have been together in our dreams, but it feels right. I'll hold out my hand so i can take hers, and i'll kiss it because I am amazed I have the privilege to. Just embracing her is enough to fill my heart and soul with warmth. The romantic in me just wants to get down on one knee right there, it just feels right as well. 

In real life, I come home everyday just hoping she would be there waiting for me, waiting for an embrace. It actually hurts a bit inside when it doesn't happen because its an impossibility. 
All i know though is when I get to hold her in my arms, I'll finally feel complete. I'll no longer have to search for anything. All i have to do is try and be what the rest of the world sees in me. Cause I know if i fall and fail, over and over again, she will be there to help me up and keep me going. She won't give up on me. She will be my muse and motivation. The anchor and sunshine in my life. When I have that love I so crave and desire, I know i'll have realized my destiny and can finally feel like I truly belong in this World. ",Low

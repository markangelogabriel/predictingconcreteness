I ring them and say â€œIâ€™m strugglingâ€, would love some company.  My neighbour organised every morning at 11am someone on my street To drop over some lunch and an activity to do ex a jigsaw, or a mind puzzle.  My mind is being active which makes me feel positive.

At first I told her I was a bit reluctant to visit because she has Rheumatoid Arthritis and is at a higher risk. She said she was on the anti malaria medication they are trialing as a treatment for COVID 19. I went to visit her and it was great to connect and watch a movie together.  I had message and FaceTime calls with friends and that was a great thing to do. I had started cleaning out my house and simplifying my life, granted I was unable to actually get rid of unwanted things that I couldnâ€™t fit in the bin, but I have pile of things I want to dispose of. I was connecting with my students via Zoom and doing classes for them, that was great because I got to see how they are all going and have a different kind of connection. Then I came up with an idea about a possible way to deliver online content that could be purchased as an add on to regular training when we return to normal life and training again. It was at that time, I received an email from my old business coach. I was undecided at first, but I had an invitation to a free webinar with him, as a way of assisting fitness professionals during COVID 19. I joined the free webinar and got quite a bit from it. I then decided it was in my best interest to pursue the of avenue further development of my idea, as the one thing I did have was time. I Had a private session with him Via zoom and told him about my idea. He thought it was a sound idea, so after some financial consideration by me, I decided to sign up with him again. I am now in the process of working on my idea and have spoken to him a few times, this has given me the opportunity to have more personal interactions. My boss is retiring tomorrow, so we were trying to workout what to do for him, I suggested we do a zoom catch up for drinks. We did that tonight and it was great to catch with my work colleagues and wish my boss the best in his retirement.

I might even schedule virtual meet ups with one or two close loved ones, to make sure I do not withdraw into my isolated shell, since scheduling these will mean I have to do it. I will probably be reluctant and worried that I might feel really unhappy at having to do so when the time comes around to carry out the meet ups because it is easier to be alone when I am down.

I wrote a message to a catholic community, hoping to receive some spiritual guidance and information about missionary work. So I applied for a volunteering role. I started reading a book about my career, however I question myself if I will have the opportunity again to pursuit my professional career.  I become addicted to documentaries from religious communities and those testimonies from people doing something useful in life, without the battle of unethical office work and hypocrisy.

232,"I feel isolated and lonely and want to feel connected to others. 
Iâ€™d start by thinking about what I mean by this statement. Do I want to feel more connected etc with family or friends or colleagues or strangers? How much effort am I willing to make? What sort of connection do I want? Do I want or expect them to come to where I am or would I prefer to go to them or somewhere in between?
Based on my reflection/answers then Iâ€™d make a bit of a plan with options? 
Who first? Which group of people? Can I do/arrange multiple things? Research groups or places or organisations etc. 
Choices Iâ€™d like to make, compromises Iâ€™m willing to make. Things I donâ€™t want or compromises that I wonâ€™t make. 
Then Iâ€™d start taking action by contacting those people and having the conversations either by text, email, phone or by person. 
Iâ€™d try to firm up arrangements but maybe itâ€™s going to take a while. Iâ€™ll try not to take it personally if someone says no or disagrees with what Iâ€™m suggesting. Their life and wants arenâ€™t a reflection on me or how they feel about me. Iâ€™ll choose to accept their choices if it fits with mine or their choice not to get involved. 
Once arrangements have been made Iâ€™ll start to feel better. 
Iâ€™ll meet them and have an interesting and happy time.

It allows for voice and video calls as well as screen sharing so we can play games together whilst chatting). I'd ask if we can all hang out, suggesting a specific time. I find if I don't give a specific time, people often don't join the call. I think this is due to differences in everyone's schedules - different people are generally online at different times so without a scheduled hangout its hard to get many people together. After organising a time, I would also give a specific activity we could do (for example, watching a movie together on Netflix using Netflix Party). This also helps people get involved. I find my friends take more active steps to be involved in the hangout if there's a specific goal we're going to achieve.

From constantly feeling down and blue, unmotivated and thinking whats the point, waking up and facing another day, just like every other day, this is a huge ordeal. Procrastination has become a new problem and with no motivation I literally have to fight the demons to make this happen. 

From choosing what to wear, putting on makeup and doing my hair, (to look human in public!) takes quite a lot of effort and time, way more than it should but feel its worth it because it gives me confidence in public and I feel that if I give the impression that if I'm still put together in appearance then it hides whats going on inside.

All of these activities were becoming very tedious. Something needed to be done. So we decided to take a close look at what we could do to be more connected to one another as it looked as though we could be together like this for an indeterminate length of time.
We have since found many things which we can do together rather than alone, for example two handed card games, things we can research together on the internet and going for long walks in the bushland around our house.

3. Write down some of the thing I have tried in the past in a list and determine whether they are appropriate now. 
4. Google the goal. Get some ideas from the net. Write down in a word doc or on paper the ones I think are either or both interesting or achievable. Rank them by both 'Optimyum to achieve the goal and ""I could do these successfully' as opposed to 'the idea is interesting but don't think I want to do that'

6. Set an incentive - e.g. a DVD I've wanted or sports clothing or even a new electronic gadget - along with a specific outcome (eg I will have tried 3 out ion the 5 ideas for a minimum of 1-2 hours)
6.Select 1 thing to do TODAY. Small / Easy thing to do. A 'SMART (Specific, Achievable. Time-bound etc)' goal. Do it today with a self-reward (chocolate bar) or tomorrow and no reward. This sets an immediate incentive.
7. Don't move forward with any other actions until completed and assessed how I did. If it didn't work, put it in the 'Too Hard' basket or 'Try again later'. It's OK to fail. It's not OK not to try at least a bit...

LIST: 
1. Make a concerted effort to contact my old friends Jane, Vicky, Anita, Sally, Rosemary, Linda, Richard, Georgie, Bridget, Shaz, Anya via phone,  text, email or skype. 
Firstly make a list of my friends - Type a generic email and alter for each individual putting in personal touches. Wait for replies and continue regular correspondence in the future. Send a text to make a time to call. (I feel I am quite lazy when it comes to keeping in contact with friends and I'm not surprised that I have few friends close by.) 
2. Learn conversational Spanish. Go through all my learn Spanish material. Do minimum 30 minutes practice daily. Enrol in a Spanish TAFE course when it opens again. Find free Spanish conversation possibilities via the internet This will help me feel more connected when I (hopefully) return to Spain for a holiday next year 
3. Start a small business selling propagated plants. 
Firsly, buy little pots and potting mix. Pot baby plants and ask my daughter to photograph these and more mature plants. Ask her to help me to set up a website to advertise and market them on the internet. I would get a lot of satisfaction earning money from my own venture rather than relying on my husband.This activity will involve valuable and mentally active time spent with my daughter and make some extra cash
4. Enrol in the lifeline telephone counselling course. Call the local lifeline centre for information regarding training. If it's within my budget, commence training and I will be able to assist needy people with advice and feel connected with other counsellors. I feel I have a good deal of life experience and plenty of free time to give back to the community
5. Enrol in an art course. (Before Covid-19 I had joined one group and started to make friends but left as it was too costly)
Contact the Queensland arts centre to join and attend Friday $5 sessions if they are still on. I love painting, learning new techniques and being with like-minded people.

I decided to text her first so that I wouldn't disturb her or make her feel uncomfortable about my approach to her and then wait for her reaction before making a further suggestion of keeping in touch with her. She seemed happy about the idea of meeting up in a local park with a takeaway coffee for a chat, of course being very aware of the current social distancing requirements.
So we met at the appointed time and place and I was pleasantly surprised to meet by chance another friend who live close by and we invited her to join us as well.

The 40 minute Zoom coffee catch up allows everyone to share in a community feel and encourages them to also contact eachother through the week.

I'd invite a small group, no more than 4 but 3 better (say by FB messenger) e.g. ""just touching base to say hi and see if any of you are up for a zoo catchup chat - maybe 3:00pm on Thursday"" .  Wait for their response, set up the preferred arrangement, and then it's actually me that makes the call when the time came.  Even though the chat might be general, some people may open up and share, who knows where the conversation will head.  Maybe the next day, I would contact just one of the group I felt a stronger connection with.  Send a message ""hey it was great to chat yesterday...perhaps I can call again so we can chat some more - I'd really appreciate that"".  Hopefully the reply would be a positive one...and if not, oh well, at least I tried.  My next effort would be something completely different e.g. a group chat on-line with strangers through a reputable support group.

364,"Firstly, actually identifying that what I am feeling is isolated and lonely and that the reason for this is that I would really like to feel more connected to other people. Many years of depression and anxiety have made this a standard step for me when a feeling is impacting my life.

I would ask myself ""is there anyone in particular I need to feel more connected to, or am I generally just feeling lonely and just need interaction with others?""

The answer to that question determines whether I reach out to someone in a particular via a phone call, text, facebook message - being cognizant of the fact that, if I am already feeling lonely and isolated, then my mental state is probably a little fragile. This would mean I would contact close family or friend to whom I can just honestly state how I am feeling, knowing they will listen to me and help me feel better just by chatting either verbally or by text. I would usually message my closest friend. These steps would make me feel connected and closer to other people who are important in my life.

If it's a more general feeling, then I would also call or message a few friends/family or perhaps an existing FB group and ask how they are going and finding out what is happening in their worlds; is there anything I can do to help them etc.

The other thing I would do, is cook a meal for a friend who is struggling either financially or mentally at the moment and drop it over to them. This satisfies my need to help others when I am limited in how I can do so, and I feel connected to them by sharing my time and energy in a positive way that gets me out of my own head for a little while.

21,"My wife and I (the current household) are both somewhat solitary by nature, except of course with one another. We relate in an amicable way with almost all other people and during my working life and membership of a city council and other formal committees and boards I had plenty of friendly acquaintances/colleagues though very few close friends. The exception is our immediate family - children and grandchildren, my brother (now 93 yo), my niece and nephews (who were our adopted children). With them we feel extremely close and normally spent a good deal of time with our descendants and some of the others every week - generally doing things for them in the case of daughters and grandchildren, or talking on the phone with others. Now our daughters do our shopping for us and bring things to us, often bringing a son with them, but maintain social distancing and do not enter our house. We maintain brief chatty connections with some neighbours, maintaining social distancing. IF I felt isolated and lonely it could only be caused by insufficient contact with those people, and with our daughters' husbands and grandson's pregnant wife. We currently speak by phone with one daughter or the other every day. Therefore IF I felt lonely and isolated I would first spend more time in the same room as my wife. Currently I work (at age 83 I manage several large portfolios on my computer and research family history) in my study while my wife spends most time on household duties and watching TV or reading in the family room. My wife has a disability that almost precludes her using a keyboard or mobile phone, so although knowledgeable she cannot physically help me. Then I would telephone my daughters and married grandson more often, although that is made difficult by the fact that one is a director in a govt department, one is the business manager of a very large college, and the third is a very intensely employed electronic engineer, and are not supposed to take private chatty calls at work. I would then try to reconnect with old friends from over 15 years ago (when I was employed) though unfortunately I have let them rather ""drift away"" due to my own rather solitary nature that always enjoys a discussion but has never enjoyed just chatting. My two major outside activities have both been closed down - attending university ""lectures/addresses"" with my wife and friends and attending the gym every other day at which I tend to meet the same people even though I don't know their surnames - so nothing much can be done about that. It would take a prolonged effort of perseverance to reconnect with old friends who I let drift away, and there would be some disappointing failures, but I would make that effort and it would end with greater connectivity. Now that I reflect on it, my absence of effort to reconnect is driven by some apprehension about rejection of the attempt. The current covid-19 situation has a strange psychological effect. My wife and I agree that apart from not going shopping and my not going to the gym, where I exercised and did not ""chat"", and missing maybe one big get-together with family or friends per month, statistically things are not all that much more confined. It is just that the compulsion makes it feel that way. 
In a nutshell the challenge is not one that I am experiencing; and in fact if I were beginning to feel that way I think I would try to suppress the feeling by immersing myself more in my work",Medium

My other friend I visit and take coffee as he is incapacitated at the moment waiting for an operation  and I just check in on him as well through the phone.

154,"I love being at home. Having all my comforts, crafts and small family around. As much as I love being at home it can be a downward staircase that slowly chips away at my happiness. Each day leads to a slow decline in motivation, self care, engagement, patience, love and support for my self and family. 
It is only on reflection I tend to realise the decline to be able to know that there was a decline. 
Itâ€™s my responsibility to kick start myself back up again. To realise that only I can make the changes that turn  this around. To mentally realise how my emotions, moods, feelings and actions are effecting me day to day as well as effecting my family and their moods. It is mentally challenging to be a Mum and wife, if that is on the decline there is a lot that goes down with it. It is isolating in the way that the more I decline the less contact I make with friends and family, the less I care then feel guilty about causing a negative thought cycle.
I need to make the decision to change my mind. That decision needs to be a daily change to ensure a plateau is created then an incline established. Iâ€™d do this by thinking about how Iâ€™m feeling physically. When did I last have a long hot bath or shower to get completely clean and feel really fresh, do my nails or wear something nice instead of shorts and T-shirt?
Knowing that I will feel amazing after this self care period - this needs to be my first step. Iâ€™d then continue to clean and organise common areas, decluttering wardrobes, cupboards, drawers etc.. clean self and environment. Iâ€™d feel the need to get organised to ensure my finances are sorted and up to date, complete a new budget to see if any small debt can be paid in full, if savings can be topped up and if phones plans or other utilities can be lowered. Iâ€™d also want my childrenâ€™s school work to be up to date, to ensure they have timetables so they know what is expected and so do I so I can assist with whatever they are working on. Already knowing these things will be coming up and passing by will give me mental relief, emotional relief and a positive feeling knowing Iâ€™m changing mine and my familyâ€™s futures by making these positive changes now. Having achieved these things and continually finding things to improve myself and future would make me feel proud. Iâ€™d then likely want to take on some sort of DIY project or craft to complete. As these things are achieved I would start to feel proud of myself, and in turn would think that these would be things my family would also be proud of. This would bring about the want to contact my family. Even a txt or photo to them starts the much needed conversation that will lead to phone calls and video chats to share what Iâ€™ve accomplished. It would also mean Iâ€™m giving my time to others for them to share what they have been doing, how theyâ€™ve been feeling which also creates a positive feeling. It would lead to video calls with the children involved that donâ€™t often get to see each other. They can also feel good and have a laugh at their cousins silly faces or pictures they drawn, books theyâ€™ve read. This makes me happy seeing them happy. It is easy to walk the spiral staircase down and it is rewarding to walk back up again. The difficulty is in owning where you are on the staircase, acknowledging a change needs to happen then taking the responsibility of self to create the action to move those steps in the opposite direction. No excuses leads to a self fulfilling and in turn shared happiness.

Family
1 using eg Facetime with oldest brother & parents
2 ring my other brother
3 send my sister text 

Relatives
1 texting & 1 FaceTime with 2 cousins more often - always great chats :) 
2 text & phone other cousins via Facebook phone & respond to there comments

Friends & Others
1 keep texting & participate in games online eg Scrabble
2 keep the distance but talk while waiting at counters ie food place
3 wave as you pass in the streets & say hello (dogs first & then maybe humans ... really how itâ€™s done!) :)
4 FOREVER thank the people who work through this to help us:  ferry staff/food/chemist/doctors & staff etc etc etc

241,"I havenâ€™t felt very connected to other people for some time as I have felt isolated and lonely. This may be partly my own doing as I have not had the motivation to keep in regular contact with friends while I was feeling down, even though they tried to engage with me.

I decide to write a list of the people who I would like to reconnect with in various ways.  Some people on my list are relatives or friends.  I decide to write them a letter to ask how they are and explain what has been going on with me.  I have always felt that I can express myself well in a letter where I have total control of what I wish to say and in the way I say it as opposed to not expressing it as well verbally.

If I do not have a mailing address I will send a Private Facebook message or a text but this would not be my preferred mode of contact as I am not overly fond of Facebook.

I would write the names of friends or acquaintances or perhaps a work colleague with whom I have previously enjoyed spending time with or can imagine would be nice to get to know better and then call them to have a chat and perhaps suggest meeting for a walk or a coffee.  It would be an activity that would be relatively short so it would not be too uncomfortable if conversation was a bit stilted.  However, I think it would be fine as I would not choose to approach a person that I did not think had some common ground with me.

I imagine that I will enjoy walking with a friend and would like to make the effort to do it regularly.  

I will also make time to talk to neighbours, even if it is just a friendly â€œHi,  how are you?â€ And also take my dog to the dog park instead of just walking as it is easy to have small talk with someone when you have a good icebreaker like a dog present.  Great Like-minded  friends can be found in dog parks.

Once I have followed through with my plans to reconnect with relatives or friends I know that I am so glad that I made the effort, I feel that I am enjoying the friendship and life in general more. It is good to feel that  I am someone that people do wish to spend time with and care about and likewise, I wish they feel the same in return.

For feeling isolated and lonely I would already think I am spending time with my wife, but I would talk to her about it, and about my need to reach out to others.
I would reach out by telephone/facetime and email to my sister and mother. I would call my mother more regularly, perhaps even daily for a while, just to say hi and check in.
Then, I would think through about my close friends who live interstate and think, who is the best to talk to in this situation. So I would think about who is most likely to be sympathetic, but also who might have time (eg do they have young kids), and I would reach out first by text message to arrange a time to chat. Then I would call them and have chats. I have, in fact, been doing exactly this over the last two months, reaching out to good friends but people who I don't see regularly because we don't even live in the same city. And there are two in particular who I can talk to about my feelings, even if I'm feeling bad. So we would talk about our jobs, but also about our feelings.
Then I would see if I could work out justifiable reasons to be able to go in to work occasionally, where even though there are not a lot of people around (because almost everyone is working from home), you can still get to see people face to face, albeit at a distance. Again, I have done this in the last two months because I have been having computer problems. So I would take my home computer in to work to get fixed, then bring home a work computer. But this would give me a reason to spend the whole day at work - my day is so full of meetings, etc, that there's not really enough time to commute in the middle of the day and still attend all my meetings effectively. So, once I go in to work for the day I usually stay for the whole day. And when I do that, I often reach out to the colleagues with whom I get on well, and who I know 1 also go in, to see if we can go in on the same days. And if that happens, then we go for a walk together or have lunch together (across a big desk), so we are still maintaining social distancing but we are also making face to face contact.
Also, I call colleagues on the mobile more often than I used to. So part of the plan involves asking people via email for their mobile phone numbers, and then ringing them rather than sending an email. It is often easier to talk things through on the phone, and you can get more done so it works better for complex communication anyway, but the bonus is that I get to talk to more people.

125,"I would ring my friends who are also isolated.    We would talk about our families and how they are coping.   If they are having problems talking to a friend might help me give advice to my family.  Just by talking to my friends and discussing what we can do to help each other relieves some of the ""isolated"" feelings. We are all in this together so Iwould tell them about my sewing and gardening and how I am now planting seeds rather than buying seedlings.  We would help each other out with various ideas and suggestions.   Recipes are another good source of comfort an exchange.  I feel happy after talking to family and friends.

777,"I would start by making a list of all the positive people I would like to connect Or reconnect with. I would then write a memorable moment that gave a positive experience when we were together. I would try to contact them and add this experience in the conversation. I would also ensure I would agree a reconnect time with them to speak in the future. Through the process or the list, remembering these experiences and reliving through connection I would feel more connected and closer to people.",Medium
947,"I would do a reality check to see if this feeling reflects reality: am I isolated? Who am I actually in contact with and how often do I communicate with them either face to face or via technology. Am I alone, what is â€˜aloneâ€™ anyway, if I can listen to the radio or read books written by amazing people. 
Next step, if there seems like thereâ€™s some obvious room for improvement like I could get out my phone list and lost six people who I might ring up, or decide to make more time to just be together with my husband and daughter, decide to have these conversations. If the first steps in solving this problem are about reality checking, it couldâ€™ve that Iâ€™m feeling lonely even though there are people around me. My dad always said: if you donâ€™t like the way the world is, change the world , or change the way you look at it. When a problem is a â€˜feelingâ€™ often the way to change your feeling is to change the way you look at it.
The next step would be to take the steps decided on, like ring up some people or spend quality time with those two I live with, or hug them and talk about how I feel. 
The final step would be to monitor and assess. Did these steps make me feel better? Do I remember how I felt before and if itâ€™s different now? If things were really bad, Iâ€™d reach out for professional help like a Counsellor to make sure I was staying mentally healthy.",High

I need to talk more and connect more starting with my partner.  I will talk to him about my feelings more than I have in the past.

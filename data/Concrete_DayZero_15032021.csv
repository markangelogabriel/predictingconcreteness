1,3,3,3,3,"I would come up with some possible suggestions of ways to connect  with friends and family that meet the social distancing rules such as video calls etc. I would  identify any specific celebrations such as birthdays coming up and think about ways to make the day special in a new kind of way. I would start making plans and scheduling in catch up times with friends and family via video conferencing. For things we would usually do regularly like family dinners instead maybe be could video conference together at the same usual time etc. This would not feel the same as we are used to and will be very different this will make us sad. Change can be difficult. We could look into online games we can play together that will make us laugh and have fun.  We still feel isolated as we cannot leave our house nor can we have visitors but  we are feeling connected with others.

0,1,0,0,0,"My wife and I (the current household) are both somewhat solitary by nature, except of course with one another. We relate in an amicable way with almost all other people and during my working life and membership of a city council and other formal committees and boards I had plenty of friendly acquaintances/colleagues though very few close friends. The exception is our immediate family - children and grandchildren, my brother (now 93 yo), my niece and nephews (who were our adopted children). With them we feel extremely close and normally spent a good deal of time with our descendants and some of the others every week - generally doing things for them in the case of daughters and grandchildren, or talking on the phone with others. Now our daughters do our shopping for us and bring things to us, often bringing a son with them, but maintain social distancing and do not enter our house. We maintain brief chatty connections with some neighbours, maintaining social distancing. IF I felt isolated and lonely it could only be caused by insufficient contact with those people, and with our daughters' husbands and grandson's pregnant wife. We currently speak by phone with one daughter or the other every day. Therefore IF I felt lonely and isolated I would first spend more time in the same room as my wife. Currently I work (at age 83 I manage several large portfolios on my computer and research family history) in my study while my wife spends most time on household duties and watching TV or reading in the family room. My wife has a disability that almost precludes her using a keyboard or mobile phone, so although knowledgeable she cannot physically help me. Then I would telephone my daughters and married grandson more often, although that is made difficult by the fact that one is a director in a govt department, one is the business manager of a very large college, and the third is a very intensely employed electronic engineer, and are not supposed to take private chatty calls at work. I would then try to reconnect with old friends from over 15 years ago (when I was employed) though unfortunately I have let them rather ""drift away"" due to my own rather solitary nature that always enjoys a discussion but has never enjoyed just chatting. My two major outside activities have both been closed down - attending university ""lectures/addresses"" with my wife and friends and attending the gym every other day at which I tend to meet the same people even though I don't know their surnames - so nothing much can be done about that. It would take a prolonged effort of perseverance to reconnect with old friends who I let drift away, and there would be some disappointing failures, but I would make that effort and it would end with greater connectivity. Now that I reflect on it, my absence of effort to reconnect is driven by some apprehension about rejection of the attempt. The current covid-19 situation has a strange psychological effect. My wife and I agree that apart from not going shopping and my not going to the gym, where I exercised and did not ""chat"", and missing maybe one big get-together with family or friends per month, statistically things are not all that much more confined. It is just that the compulsion makes it feel that way.

So we decided to take a close look at what we could do to be more connected to one another as it looked as though we could be together like this for an indeterminate length of time.
We have since found many things which we can do together rather than alone, for example two handed card games, things we can research together on the internet and going for long walks in the bushland around our house.

3,4,3,3,3,"I love being at home. Having all my comforts, crafts and small family around. As much as I love being at home it can be a downward staircase that slowly chips away at my happiness. Each day leads to a slow decline in motivation, self care, engagement, patience, love and support for my self and family. 
It is only on reflection I tend to realise the decline to be able to know that there was a decline. 
Itâ€™s my responsibility to kick start myself back up again. To realise that only I can make the changes that turn  this around. To mentally realise how my emotions, moods, feelings and actions are effecting me day to day as well as effecting my family and their moods. It is mentally challenging to be a Mum and wife, if that is on the decline there is a lot that goes down with it. It is isolating in the way that the more I decline the less contact I make with friends and family, the less I care then feel guilty about causing a negative thought cycle.
I need to make the decision to change my mind. That decision needs to be a daily change to ensure a plateau is created then an incline established. Iâ€™d do this by thinking about how Iâ€™m feeling physically. When did I last have a long hot bath or shower to get completely clean and feel really fresh, do my nails or wear something nice instead of shorts and T-shirt?
Knowing that I will feel amazing after this self care period - this needs to be my first step. Iâ€™d then continue to clean and organise common areas, decluttering wardrobes, cupboards, drawers etc.. clean self and environment. Iâ€™d feel the need to get organised to ensure my finances are sorted and up to date, complete a new budget to see if any small debt can be paid in full, if savings can be topped up and if phones plans or other utilities can be lowered. Iâ€™d also want my childrenâ€™s school work to be up to date, to ensure they have timetables so they know what is expected and so do I so I can assist with whatever they are working on. Already knowing these things will be coming up and passing by will give me mental relief, emotional relief and a positive feeling knowing Iâ€™m changing mine and my familyâ€™s futures by making these positive changes now. Having achieved these things and continually finding things to improve myself and future would make me feel proud. Iâ€™d then likely want to take on some sort of DIY project or craft to complete. As these things are achieved I would start to feel proud of myself, and in turn would think that these would be things my family would also be proud of. This would bring about the want to contact my family. Even a txt or photo to them starts the much needed conversation that will lead to phone calls and video chats to share what Iâ€™ve accomplished. It would also mean Iâ€™m giving my time to others for them to share what they have been doing, how theyâ€™ve been feeling which also creates a positive feeling. It would lead to video calls with the children involved that donâ€™t often get to see each other. They can also feel good and have a laugh at their cousins silly faces or pictures they drawn, books theyâ€™ve read. This makes me happy seeing them happy. It is easy to walk the spiral staircase down and it is rewarding to walk back up again. The difficulty is in owning where you are on the staircase, acknowledging a change needs to happen then taking the responsibility of self to create the action to move those steps in the opposite direction. No excuses leads to a self fulfilling and in turn shared happiness.

Making a list each day of people I intend to call or email which I could tick off once completed would be a start. Using the technological methods such as Zoom to see people face to face regularly would also be of use with several different groups accessed on a weekly basis: family and friends. 
While remaining within social/physical distancing rules, I would make an effort to see a friend for a walk or have a friend visit for a coffee or drink. I would also make sure my husband and I spent some time walking, gardening, or spending close time together regularly. 
Another way I think I would/could connect with others would be to do something for other people each day such as cook something or drop off something or send a gift via online shopping. 
It would also be important to acknowledge those times when I was feeling disconnected and lonely and make an extra effort to call or connect with someone to whom I know I could be honest about how I was feeling. I could also reassure myself that it is likely the situation will improve eventually and more normal human interaction can resume. I could also reassure myself that I have weathered other adverse feelings and situations in the past and have the capacity within myself to do this.
I would also remind myself to continue to do those things which maintain and sustain my physical and mental health such as sleeping and eating properly, exercising, meditating, doing some yoga so my down times would be more able to be managed.

I decide to write a list of the people who I would like to reconnect with in various ways.  Some people on my list are relatives or friends.  I decide to write them a letter to ask how they are and explain what has been going on with me.  I have always felt that I can express myself well in a letter where I have total control of what I wish to say and in the way I say it as opposed to not expressing it as well verbally.

If I do not have a mailing address I will send a Private Facebook message or a text but this would not be my preferred mode of contact as I am not overly fond of Facebook.

I would write the names of friends or acquaintances or perhaps a work colleague with whom I have previously enjoyed spending time with or can imagine would be nice to get to know better and then call them to have a chat and perhaps suggest meeting for a walk or a coffee.  It would be an activity that would be relatively short so it would not be too uncomfortable if conversation was a bit stilted.  However, I think it would be fine as I would not choose to approach a person that I did not think had some common ground with me.

I imagine that I will enjoy walking with a friend and would like to make the effort to do it regularly.  

I will also make time to talk to neighbours, even if it is just a friendly â€œHi,  how are you?â€ And also take my dog to the dog park instead of just walking as it is easy to have small talk with someone when you have a good icebreaker like a dog present.  Great Like-minded  friends can be found in dog parks.

Once I have followed through with my plans to reconnect with relatives or friends I know that I am so glad that I made the effort, I feel that I am enjoying the friendship and life in general more. It is good to feel that  I am someone that people do wish to spend time with and care about and likewise, I wish they feel the same in return.

4,4,4,2,4,"Feeling alone in the World is complex to me. A large part of it is physical connection. I am very visceral, I like to express myself through touch and emotion. But for me, to have a true connection, there is always that something more, something extra, that you feel with certain people. When you know, you just know. Some people just exist on that same wavelength as you.

I rarely feel like I even belong on this World. For the longest time in my life I felt alone and isolated simply because I did not feel understood or even heard. These days my words seem to carry more weight than ever before; even more than I would like 1. Amazingly, the feeling of emptiness and loneliness has vastly improved since the lock down. I have managed to actually reconnect with almost everyone important in my life now. Maybe this is because everyone was forced to slow down and actually had the the time to. Or maybe it was the lack of pressure to be productive that gave me the energy to do it. 
Either way, I don't feel as lonely or isolated, but I still feel like something is really missing. 
I have that extra connection with these people but i don't have that physical aspect. I need the companionship to complete me. I want someone to be there for me, support me in what I do and stand by my side when things get tough and truly work for us to be the best we can be, together. Just hold me when I need to cry, squeeze my hand just because they like the feeling of it. I want someone who will love and devote them self to me as much as I would to them. 
I know its not me against the World anymore, if anything I have the support of the World behind me. But i still want that partner in crime, that ride or die, the girl of my dreams. 
And I have found her. I just don't know how it will happen. In my dreams I just receive a card in the mail, or under my door, by the powers that be. All it says on it is her name, on the back is where I need to be and what time. I think i'm going crazy but I take the leap of faith anyway; I buy the most amazing flowers I can find and I just go and wait. I desperately hope this isn't some cruel prank. But its worth the risk of embarrassment because I've been searching for her all my life. I want to believe in miracles. 
And then it happens. She appears. It'll be awkward because we only have been together in our dreams, but it feels right. I'll hold out my hand so i can take hers, and i'll kiss it because I am amazed I have the privilege to. Just embracing her is enough to fill my heart and soul with warmth. The romantic in me just wants to get down on one knee right there, it just feels right as well. 

In real life, I come home everyday just hoping she would be there waiting for me, waiting for an embrace. It actually hurts a bit inside when it doesn't happen because its an impossibility. 
All i know though is when I get to hold her in my arms, I'll finally feel complete. I'll no longer have to search for anything. All i have to do is try and be what the rest of the world sees in me. Cause I know if i fall and fail, over and over again, she will be there to help me up and keep me going. She won't give up on me. She will be my muse and motivation. The anchor and sunshine in my life. When I have that love I so crave and desire, I know i'll have realized my destiny and can finally feel like I truly belong in this World.

The dog bounds into my bedroom and obviously delighted to see me - as I am her. I certainly feel buoyed by her boisterous and constant attention. My dear husband makes me a cup of tea and brings it to me whilst enquiring if I'd like something to eat. I'm feeling the love! I look outside and see a lovely day with blue skies. My husband suggests that we take the dog down to the opened dog park (Kedron Brook) near us, which we do. The sheer delight of watching the dog's antics chasing a ball, swimming, interacting with other dogs makes my heart melt. Not only did I get out of the house to exercise on a lovely day with clear blue skies, I also interacted by nodding, verbally acknowledging other dog owners etc. The endorphins had kicked it and I felt connected and closer to people.

0,2,4,4,2,"Firstly, actually identifying that what I am feeling is isolated and lonely and that the reason for this is that I would really like to feel more connected to other people. Many years of depression and anxiety have made this a standard step for me when a feeling is impacting my life.

I would ask myself ""is there anyone in particular I need to feel more connected to, or am I generally just feeling lonely and just need interaction with others?""

The answer to that question determines whether I reach out to someone in a particular via a phone call, text, facebook message - being cognizant of the fact that, if I am already feeling lonely and isolated, then my mental state is probably a little fragile. This would mean I would contact close family or friend to whom I can just honestly state how I am feeling, knowing they will listen to me and help me feel better just by chatting either verbally or by text. I would usually message my closest friend. These steps would make me feel connected and closer to other people who are important in my life.

If it's a more general feeling, then I would also call or message a few friends/family or perhaps an existing FB group and ask how they are going and finding out what is happening in their worlds; is there anything I can do to help them etc.

The other thing I would do, is cook a meal for a friend who is struggling either financially or mentally at the moment and drop it over to them. This satisfies my need to help others when I am limited in how I can do so, and I feel connected to them by sharing my time and energy in a positive way that gets me out of my own head for a little while.

2. Organise Facetime with my grandchildren. 
3. Set up a group chat on Messenger with my friends.
4. Interact with my Facebook ""family"" 
5. Watch some UTube.

I then went through my fb friends that I'd seen lately, prior to COVID-19 and began to video call the ones I knew would be grateful for a chat. It was very successful and I'm sure everyone felt better for the video call.

I organised a zoom meeting and all but one person joined in. It was fun and very stimulating hearing everyone's news and how they were feeling.

My family are more likely to return my calls but I feel closer to friends who live a long way away. Often, I haven't contacted them apart from the odd Christmas card but now I have the time to see how they are coping. This has renewed old friendships and makes me feel my time has been well spent.

The Facebook page offers the opportunity for our members to read each other's stories and comment on them. I am about to suggest Zoom as a more intimate face to face meeting. I'm not sure how this will work as most of my group are not au fait with this technology. It would be an interesting exercise to help them learn something new.

I might also send a msg to some of my non household friends I have been thinking of and check in on how they are going, whether they would like to connect, and chat via phone or video call and/or organise a  suitable time for us to spend communicating and connecting over the phone or video. Might even spend some time writing them an email, sharing pics, voice mail generally reaching out and checking in with how we are all feeling in these times, which will also remind me that we are all experiencing the same challenges, feelings, emotions and may gain some new ideas, skills, spark my imagination further on different ways of thinking, doing and looking at the current situation, learning more about myself along the way!

I wonder if I should join a group of people who share my hobbies, there seem to be more popping up that invite remote participation and maybe someone can recommend something? Can I engage with people I donâ€™t know yet remotely? Wonâ€™t it be awkward?

3,4,4,3,3,"I live in a gated ""50+"" community, independent living (ie NOT retirement village).  Even pre-Covid found that the couples tended not to mix with the singles/widows.  So we set up our own group, a monthly breakfast where we planned activities/outings for the month.  Also started a cards group and mah jong.  All these stopped with social distancing.  I had also set up a community website, from which I resigned following some family trauma elsewhere and personality clashes here (I call them the Bossy Old Men Brigade (BOMB) who are irritated by intelligent women, but in all honesty I am prickly too.  So I sent in some ideas how we could really use the website (online competitions, mutual help pages, all the usual) and offered to come back in as a 'gopher' to help. All accepted gratefully except the head BOMB who was nasty and so was his wife.  Plus my UK son is doing it hard post cancer, locked up at home with wife and 4 kids, relationship in trouble and typical 40+ male won't talk about it.
So I nosedived, and felt very isolated and lonely.  And lost a much loved person in the UK to covid over Easter;  he was a kind of 'big brother' to me when i was younger.  Ho - bottom of the treacle well.
BUT all was not lost - I was lucky to have two singles living close to me, who knew and they reached out to me.  I as usual was prickly and didn't want help but they pushed.  
And shared their problems.  That was a key point -- we all 3 have difficult adult sons, and problems which were surprisingly similar.  So we fell into the habit of chatting regularly, and of course in such a community we meet on the street.  Then we set up a weekly card game.  I responded to a community callout to help those who needed it (eg a new single home owner, social isolation and has no car!) to offer to help, eg shopping, etc.  Or computer help as I'm quite good at that.
So, it was a question of opening up to other people, admitting my own difficulties,  being truthful and less prickly and self absorbed.  I am not alone in this, but also need to learn not to go overboard and offer more than I am really willing to give on a regular basis - it's OK to set boundaries.  Also, I have a Jack Russell terrier who needs exercising, I cannot walk far so I use a mobility scooter.  Just going up and down the streets and into the green spaces I see / talk to others every day and it helps.  I feel better, and I managed to get on top of a couple of tasks that had been hanging over me.  But the best of all is what follows:
I received an anonymous card in my (community) mailbox. with a pic of a koala.  The message read:
Hi Gina,  Hope you like this card.  It's to let you know that you are cared about very much.  I love to see you ride past on your scooter with a smile always on your face.  It's been a very sad time for you just lately, but I'm hoping you feel better soon.  You have friends who care.  x  x  x 
I checked all the usual suspects who all hotly denied it, and my widow friend over the road remarked 'if it was anonymous the person wants to be anonymous - stop hunting it down and just accept the kindness'.  Sage advice.
So now I feel better, more able to tackle tasks, and more accepting of my own shortcomings.  We so often hound ourselves for our failures and downplay our good bits.  I'm not so bad after all.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,0,72,65-79,Female,Yes - past,Bachelor University Degree(s),Retired,,Yes - with mild core activity limitation,55,2,0,0,0,0,Dog(s),3,2,2,2,3,3,6,8,31,2,63,2,0

0,3,2,3,2,In order to get over feeling isolated and lonely I would pick up my phone and call some friends or family. This would remind me the current situation is not permanent and I will see these people again soon. I would also message friends on Facebook. Also I might arrange to play bridge on line with some friends. This would make me feel connected again.,1.5,1.5,1,1.5,0,58,45-64,Female,No,Postgraduate University Degree(s),Retired,,No,40,2,1,1,0,0,Cat(s),2,2,2,1,3,3,4,5,9,1,63,12,0
1,3,1,1,1,"So, if I feel isolated and lonely I would think, who can I reach out to? This would have different categories: 1) my wife and child (but I would worry about putting too much pressure on my child, so I would really reach out to my wife and try to enjoy my child more 2) my sister and mother who live interstate 3) my close friends, many of whom also live interstate 4) my colleagues and co-workers.
For feeling isolated and lonely I would already think I am spending time with my wife, but I would talk to her about it, and about my need to reach out to others.
I would reach out by telephone/facetime and email to my sister and mother. I would call my mother more regularly, perhaps even daily for a while, just to say hi and check in.
Then, I would think through about my close friends who live interstate and think, who is the best to talk to in this situation. So I would think about who is most likely to be sympathetic, but also who might have time (eg do they have young kids), and I would reach out first by text message to arrange a time to chat. Then I would call them and have chats. I have, in fact, been doing exactly this over the last two months, reaching out to good friends but people who I don't see regularly because we don't even live in the same city. And there are two in particular who I can talk to about my feelings, even if I'm feeling bad. So we would talk about our jobs, but also about our feelings.
Then I would see if I could work out justifiable reasons to be able to go in to work occasionally, where even though there are not a lot of people around (because almost everyone is working from home), you can still get to see people face to face, albeit at a distance. Again, I have done this in the last two months because I have been having computer problems. So I would take my home computer in to work to get fixed, then bring home a work computer. But this would give me a reason to spend the whole day at work - my day is so full of meetings, etc, that there's not really enough time to commute in the middle of the day and still attend all my meetings effectively. So, once I go in to work for the day I usually stay for the whole day. And when I do that, I often reach out to the colleagues with whom I get on well, and who I know 1 also go in, to see if we can go in on the same days. And if that happens, then we go for a walk together or have lunch together (across a big desk), so we are still maintaining social distancing but we are also making face to face contact.
Also, I call colleagues on the mobile more often than I used to. So part of the plan involves asking people via email for their mobile phone numbers, and then ringing them rather than sending an email. It is often easier to talk things through on the phone, and you can get more done so it works better for complex communication anyway, but the bonus is that I get to talk to more people.

I would start by texting a few people on my â€˜text listâ€™, just to say that was thinking of them and was hoping they were doing okay. I would do this first as it would give me a feeling of achievement and wouldnâ€™t dig too deep into my feelings of loneliness and isolation.

2. Write down my goal somewhere. Maybe on my PC screen (e-post-it). At the very least a post-it note the sticks to the PC itself but maybe an A4 or a Word document that I can open up and add to about how I am progressing vs. the goal.
3. Write down some of the thing I have tried in the past in a list and determine whether they are appropriate now. 
4. Google the goal. Get some ideas from the net. Write down in a word doc or on paper the ones I think are either or both interesting or achievable. Rank them by both 'Optimyum to achieve the goal and ""I could do these successfully' as opposed to 'the idea is interesting but don't think I want to do that'
5. Select 3-5 ideas of the 'top ranking' ideas to do over the next 1-2 weeks. 
6. Set an incentive - e.g. a DVD I've wanted or sports clothing or even a new electronic gadget - along with a specific outcome (eg I will have tried 3 out ion the 5 ideas for a minimum of 1-2 hours)
6.Select 1 thing to do TODAY. Small / Easy thing to do. A 'SMART (Specific, Achievable. Time-bound etc)' goal. Do it today with a self-reward (chocolate bar) or tomorrow and no reward. This sets an immediate incentive.
7. Don't move forward with any other actions until completed and assessed how I did. If it didn't work, put it in the 'Too Hard' basket or 'Try again later'. It's OK to fail. It's not OK not to try at least a bit...
8. Work though the list, one at a time until some achievement towards the goal. Write up achievements and note failures and what I'm doing wrong. 
9. If possible check with someone trusted/close/non-judgemental how I'm doing... even the doctor if no-one else.

1,3,0,3,2,"I would make a list of about 5 activities that I have already been thinking I would like to do that could enable me to become more social so I could engage with other people (including face to face, phone, text, email, video conferencing)

LIST: 
1. Make a concerted effort to contact my old friends Jane, Vicky, Anita, Sally, Rosemary, Linda, Richard, Georgie, Bridget, Shaz, Anya via phone,  text, email or skype. 
Firstly make a list of my friends - Type a generic email and alter for each individual putting in personal touches. Wait for replies and continue regular correspondence in the future. Send a text to make a time to call. (I feel I am quite lazy when it comes to keeping in contact with friends and I'm not surprised that I have few friends close by.) 
2. Learn conversational Spanish. Go through all my learn Spanish material. Do minimum 30 minutes practice daily. Enrol in a Spanish TAFE course when it opens again. Find free Spanish conversation possibilities via the internet This will help me feel more connected when I (hopefully) return to Spain for a holiday next year 
3. Start a small business selling propagated plants. 
Firsly, buy little pots and potting mix. Pot baby plants and ask my daughter to photograph these and more mature plants. Ask her to help me to set up a website to advertise and market them on the internet. I would get a lot of satisfaction earning money from my own venture rather than relying on my husband.This activity will involve valuable and mentally active time spent with my daughter and make some extra cash
4. Enrol in the lifeline telephone counselling course. Call the local lifeline centre for information regarding training. If it's within my budget, commence training and I will be able to assist needy people with advice and feel connected with other counsellors. I feel I have a good deal of life experience and plenty of free time to give back to the community
5. Enrol in an art course. (Before Covid-19 I had joined one group and started to make friends but left as it was too costly)
Contact the Queensland arts centre to join and attend Friday $5 sessions if they are still on. I love painting, learning new techniques and being with like-minded people.

I know that it would bring up memories, some good, some not so much maybe.
And then, of course go through the list i had just made decide who i would love to speak to. An 'old friend' not acquaintance. Someone who or some inexplicable reason had drifted or gradually petered out, or just one day stopped writing , texting, or calling.
I would know how such a call from me, out of the blue, would please some, astonish some,be welcomed by some, ignored by some or possibly ignored by some, blocked , maybe, by some.
Then, I would, feeling happy, confident and ready to hear their voice again call them.
Shivers of nervous energy cascading like waves, i would encounter as it rang, and rang and then finally the familiar voice, probably saying ""OMG, Hello"". 
I'd feel my body relax, strengthen and the finally say
""Ya know what, you are such a little f****r. What, I suddenly became superfluous, you dropped your phone down the loo ? 
Or still just a complete dick for not even bothering to call me after all the help and time i spent on you. 
Not to mention everything else you drained me off. So as we all have extra time at the moment to think and remember, I thought I would take ths opportinity to tell you, 'Congratulation. You've won 'The Co-Vid 19 Award for 2020'. It is awarded to the person that has the most things in common with the Corona Virus. And you my friend appear to have an endless list of similarities.
To name a few: 
1 You cause more dramas than the virus
2 You make more people sick, by being you than the virus
3 You are less welcome in homes, than the virus
4 You made the curve currently attempting to be straightend
5 Nobody survives in tact meeting or knowing you

The simply say   ""HAPPY CO-VID""

From constantly feeling down and blue, unmotivated and thinking whats the point, waking up and facing another day, just like every other day, this is a huge ordeal. Procrastination has become a new problem and with no motivation I literally have to fight the demons to make this happen. 

From choosing what to wear, putting on makeup and doing my hair, (to look human in public!) takes quite a lot of effort and time, way more than it should but feel its worth it because it gives me confidence in public and I feel that if I give the impression that if I'm still put together in appearance then it hides whats going on inside.

After walking around in circles for too long than I feel comfortable with, I make myself leave the house and walk down to the local shops. I feel anxious and kind of afraid for some reason.

Once I have talked to a couple of shopkeepers and a couple of random strangers on the way I'm starting to feel a lot better. My mind is otherwise occupied while engaging with people so the angst is kept at bay during this time.

I would start making plans and scheduling in catch up times with friends and family via video conferencing. For things we would usually do regularly like family dinners instead maybe be could video conference together at the same usual time etc. This would not feel the same as we are used to and will be very different this will make us sad. Change can be difficult. We could look into online games we can play together that will make us laugh and have fun.  We still feel isolated as we cannot leave our house nor can we have visitors but  we are feeling connected with others.

We relate in an amicable way with almost all other people and during my working life and membership of a city council and other formal committees and boards I had plenty of friendly acquaintances/colleagues though very few close friends. The exception is our immediate family - children and grandchildren, my brother (now 93 yo), my niece and nephews (who were our adopted children). With them we feel extremely close and normally spent a good deal of time with our descendants and some of the others every week - generally doing things for them in the case of daughters and grandchildren, or talking on the phone with others. Now our daughters do our shopping for us and bring things to us, often bringing a son with them, but maintain social distancing and do not enter our house. We maintain brief chatty connections with some neighbours, maintaining social distancing. IF I felt isolated and lonely it could only be caused by insufficient contact with those people, and with our daughters' husbands and grandson's pregnant wife. We currently speak by phone with one daughter or the other every day. Therefore IF I felt lonely and isolated I would first spend more time in the same room as my wife. Currently I work (at age 83 I manage several large portfolios on my computer and research family history) in my study while my wife spends most time on household duties and watching TV or reading in the family room. My wife has a disability that almost precludes her using a keyboard or mobile phone, so although knowledgeable she cannot physically help me. Then I would telephone my daughters and married grandson more often, although that is made difficult by the fact that one is a director in a govt department, one is the business manager of a very large college, and the third is a very intensely employed electronic engineer, and are not supposed to take private chatty calls at work. I would then try to reconnect with old friends from over 15 years ago (when I was employed) though unfortunately I have let them rather ""drift away"" due to my own rather solitary nature that always enjoys a discussion but has never enjoyed just chatting. My two major outside activities have both been closed down - attending university ""lectures/addresses"" with my wife and friends and attending the gym every other day at which I tend to meet the same people even though I don't know their surnames - so nothing much can be done about that. It would take a prolonged effort of perseverance to reconnect with old friends who I let drift away, and there would be some disappointing failures, but I would make that effort and it would end with greater connectivity. Now that I reflect on it, my absence of effort to reconnect is driven by some apprehension about rejection of the attempt. The current covid-19 situation has a strange psychological effect. My wife and I agree that apart from not going shopping and my not going to the gym, where I exercised and did not ""chat"", and missing maybe one big get-together with family or friends per month, statistically things are not all that much more confined. It is just that the compulsion makes it feel that way. 
In a nutshell the challenge is not one that I am experiencing; and in fact if I were beginning to feel that way I think I would try to suppress the feeling by immersing myself more in my work",JL,,5,3,3,2,2.5,1.5,1.5,1,2.5,1.5,1.5,1,0

First I will ring my friend who lives next to the nearby church to get details of how they are streaming services. I will go online and do a tutorial on the software and practice using it. I will ring my friend again to check on the time of service and make sure I understand how to join in next Sunday. I will ring another member of church to see if I need anything (a hymn book?) or if I can contribute anything to the service such as flowers from my garden. I will check the website of the church to verify details and see if there are other activities. On Sunday I will feel more connected to the people I used to see on Sunday by joining in by Zoom on my smartphone.,CP,,5,5,4,3,2.5,2.5,2,1.5,2.5,2.5,2,1.5,0

If it's more to do with being tired etc. I might start by dealing with that first - go for a walk in the sunshine, watch something interesting on telly or perhaps have a nap. If it is because I haven't engaged with friends / family for a while I think about who is around and how best to engage with them.  I live by myself but am lucky that I can always speak to my parents on the phone or by email, and I connect with friends in different ways.  I try to actively keep track of when I last caught up with each of my close friends. Some of them are up for talking on the phone or by video call and some prefer text or email.  That gives me a variety of ways to keep in contact and minimise any feelings of isolation. I try to ensure that I connect with at least one friend each day in way that helps me feel connected and a way that they like.  My friends and family who live interstate and overseas seem to be more up for video chats than my Perth friends, so I have also found that I am having more regular video chats with those friends who I would usually just keep in contact with via Facebook posts.  Ironically we are feeling more connected at the moment than we usually do.  I also find that listening to local radio helps me feel connected to the community so if I am feeling isolated I might turn on ABC Perth just to catch up on some local news and conversation.",CP,CP,5,4,3,4,2.5,2,1.5,2,2.5,2,1.5,2,0

It turned out that my wife was also having feelings of disconnection. Habits had been established over this time in which we tended to do the same things routinely each day, such as play Sudoku, have breakfast, do crossword puzzles, sit at our computers and watch TV with maybe a little exercise thrown in. All of these activities were becoming very tedious. Something needed to be done. So we decided to take a close look at what we could do to be more connected to one another as it looked as though we could be together like this for an indeterminate length of time.
We have since found many things which we can do together rather than alone, for example two handed card games, things we can research together on the internet and going for long walks in the bushland around our house.
So we look on this as a positive change in our lives and a timely reminder of the need to remodel our way of life.  In hindsight we would probably have needed to establish this modified life pattern sometime in the near future irrespective of the spectre of Covid-19.",LL,,3,4,5,4,1.5,2,2.5,2,1.5,2,2.5,2,0

I miss my weekly pub quiz, so I spend time at the weekend writing a quiz to play on zoom, and spend time making sure that the questions aren’t to hard or easy, and that I can play music and picture rounds too, so that the quiz isn’t dull. I try to make the questions relevant to the experiences of our friendship group, Regardless of whether the question are about science or history or sport.

On the movie night, we would each watch the movie in our own homes and either msg each other through the course of the movie, or video chat during it. 
After the movie, we would catch up on how each of us is going, giving each of us a chance to vent if needed.

Having all my comforts, crafts and small family around. As much as I love being at home it can be a downward staircase that slowly chips away at my happiness. Each day leads to a slow decline in motivation, self care, engagement, patience, love and support for my self and family. 
It is only on reflection I tend to realise the decline to be able to know that there was a decline. 
It’s my responsibility to kick start myself back up again. To realise that only I can make the changes that turn  this around. To mentally realise how my emotions, moods, feelings and actions are effecting me day to day as well as effecting my family and their moods. It is mentally challenging to be a Mum and wife, if that is on the decline there is a lot that goes down with it. It is isolating in the way that the more I decline the less contact I make with friends and family, the less I care then feel guilty about causing a negative thought cycle.
I need to make the decision to change my mind. That decision needs to be a daily change to ensure a plateau is created then an incline established. I’d do this by thinking about how I’m feeling physically. When did I last have a long hot bath or shower to get completely clean and feel really fresh, do my nails or wear something nice instead of shorts and T-shirt?
Knowing that I will feel amazing after this self care period - this needs to be my first step. I’d then continue to clean and organise common areas, decluttering wardrobes, cupboards, drawers etc.. clean self and environment. I’d feel the need to get organised to ensure my finances are sorted and up to date, complete a new budget to see if any small debt can be paid in full, if savings can be topped up and if phones plans or other utilities can be lowered. I’d also want my children’s school work to be up to date, to ensure they have timetables so they know what is expected and so do I so I can assist with whatever they are working on. Already knowing these things will be coming up and passing by will give me mental relief, emotional relief and a positive feeling knowing I’m changing mine and my family’s futures by making these positive changes now. Having achieved these things and continually finding things to improve myself and future would make me feel proud. I’d then likely want to take on some sort of DIY project or craft to complete. As these things are achieved I would start to feel proud of myself, and in turn would think that these would be things my family would also be proud of. This would bring about the want to contact my family. Even a txt or photo to them starts the much needed conversation that will lead to phone calls and video chats to share what I’ve accomplished. It would also mean I’m giving my time to others for them to share what they have been doing, how they’ve been feeling which also creates a positive feeling. It would lead to video calls with the children involved that don’t often get to see each other. They can also feel good and have a laugh at their cousins silly faces or pictures they drawn, books they’ve read. This makes me happy seeing them happy. It is easy to walk the spiral staircase down and it is rewarding to walk back up again. The difficulty is in owning where you are on the staircase, acknowledging a change needs to happen then taking the responsibility of self to create the action to move those steps in the opposite direction. No excuses leads to a self fulfilling and in turn shared happiness.

However, I think it would be fine as I would not choose to approach a person that I did not think had some common ground with me.

I imagine that I will enjoy walking with a friend and would like to make the effort to do it regularly.  

I will also make time to talk to neighbours, even if it is just a friendly “Hi,  how are you?” And also take my dog to the dog park instead of just walking as it is easy to have small talk with someone when you have a good icebreaker like a dog present.  Great Like-minded  friends can be found in dog parks.

Once I have followed through with my plans to reconnect with relatives or friends I know that I am so glad that I made the effort, I feel that I am enjoying the friendship and life in general more. It is good to feel that  I am someone that people do wish to spend time with and care about and likewise, I wish they feel the same in return.

A large part of it is physical connection. I am very visceral, I like to express myself through touch and emotion. But for me, to have a true connection, there is always that something more, something extra, that you feel with certain people. When you know, you just know. Some people just exist on that same wavelength as you.

I rarely feel like I even belong on this World. For the longest time in my life I felt alone and isolated simply because I did not feel understood or even heard. These days my words seem to carry more weight than ever before; even more than I would like sometimes. Amazingly, the feeling of emptiness and loneliness has vastly improved since the lock down. I have managed to actually reconnect with almost everyone important in my life now. Maybe this is because everyone was forced to slow down and actually had the the time to. Or maybe it was the lack of pressure to be productive that gave me the energy to do it. 
Either way, I don't feel as lonely or isolated, but I still feel like something is really missing. 
I have that extra connection with these people but i don't have that physical aspect. I need the companionship to complete me. I want someone to be there for me, support me in what I do and stand by my side when things get tough and truly work for us to be the best we can be, together. Just hold me when I need to cry, squeeze my hand just because they like the feeling of it. I want someone who will love and devote them self to me as much as I would to them. 
I know its not me against the World anymore, if anything I have the support of the World behind me. But i still want that partner in crime, that ride or die, the girl of my dreams. 
And I have found her. I just don't know how it will happen. In my dreams I just receive a card in the mail, or under my door, by the powers that be. All it says on it is her name, on the back is where I need to be and what time. I think i'm going crazy but I take the leap of faith anyway; I buy the most amazing flowers I can find and I just go and wait. I desperately hope this isn't some cruel prank. But its worth the risk of embarrassment because I've been searching for her all my life. I want to believe in miracles. 
And then it happens. She appears. It'll be awkward because we only have been together in our dreams, but it feels right. I'll hold out my hand so i can take hers, and i'll kiss it because I am amazed I have the privilege to. Just embracing her is enough to fill my heart and soul with warmth. The romantic in me just wants to get down on one knee right there, it just feels right as well. 

In real life, I come home everyday just hoping she would be there waiting for me, waiting for an embrace. It actually hurts a bit inside when it doesn't happen because its an impossibility. 
All i know though is when I get to hold her in my arms, I'll finally feel complete. I'll no longer have to search for anything. All i have to do is try and be what the rest of the world sees in me. Cause I know if i fall and fail, over and over again, she will be there to help me up and keep me going. She won't give up on me. She will be my muse and motivation. The anchor and sunshine in my life. When I have that love I so crave and desire, I know i'll have realized my destiny and can finally feel like I truly belong in this World.

Many years of depression and anxiety have made this a standard step for me when a feeling is impacting my life.

I would ask myself ""is there anyone in particular I need to feel more connected to, or am I generally just feeling lonely and just need interaction with others?""

The answer to that question determines whether I reach out to someone in a particular via a phone call, text, facebook message - being cognizant of the fact that, if I am already feeling lonely and isolated, then my mental state is probably a little fragile. This would mean I would contact close family or friend to whom I can just honestly state how I am feeling, knowing they will listen to me and help me feel better just by chatting either verbally or by text. I would usually message my closest friend. These steps would make me feel connected and closer to other people who are important in my life.

If it's a more general feeling, then I would also call or message a few friends/family or perhaps an existing FB group and ask how they are going and finding out what is happening in their worlds; is there anything I can do to help them etc.

The other thing I would do, is cook a meal for a friend who is struggling either financially or mentally at the moment and drop it over to them. This satisfies my need to help others when I am limited in how I can do so, and I feel connected to them by sharing my time and energy in a positive way that gets me out of my own head for a little while.

2. Organise Facetime with my grandchildren. 
3. Set up a group chat on Messenger with my friends.
4. Interact with my Facebook ""family"" 
5. Watch some UTube.

I will scroll through my phone to see which messages from friends and family I have not responded to.

I might even schedule virtual meet ups with one or two close loved ones, to make sure I do not withdraw into my isolated shell, since scheduling these will mean I have to do it. I will probably be reluctant and worried that I might feel really unhappy at having to do so when the time comes around to carry out the meet ups because it is easier to be alone when I am down.

I took my bike and rode to the bakery to get some fresh warm bread, the ladies were happy to see me and I gave them a big smile which made them even happier. On the way back, I stopped by the side of the road and called the water utilities to report a water leak on the road. I then came across two of my neighbours walking their dogs, one of them has a disability and has problems walking. I stopped and had a chat with them about school and the increase in traffic through the native reserve against which we live. We walked back together to the street and my house. I rushed upstairs to share the warm bread I had bought with my family and while having breakfast on the verandah, I had this nice feeling of feeling connected and closer to people.",AM,,3,3,4,5,1.5,1.5,2,2.5,1.5,1.5,2,2.5,0

I had message and FaceTime calls with friends and that was a great thing to do.

I was connecting with my students via Zoom and doing classes for them, that was great because I got to see how they are all going and have a different kind of connection. Then I came up with an idea about a possible way to deliver online content that could be purchased as an add on to regular training when we return to normal life and training again. It was at that time, I received an email from my old business coach. I was undecided at first, but I had an invitation to a free webinar with him, as a way of assisting fitness professionals during COVID 19. I joined the free webinar and got quite a bit from it. I then decided it was in my best interest to pursue the of avenue further development of my idea, as the one thing I did have was time. I Had a private session with him Via zoom and told him about my idea. He thought it was a sound idea, so after some financial consideration by me, I decided to sign up with him again. I am now in the process of working on my idea and have spoken to him a few times, this has given me the opportunity to have more personal interactions.

I decide that connecting with some friends and family will help me feel better. Due to covid 19 restrictions I can not visit people so I decide to call some people and do a video call too. My sister does not have video call facilities so I decide to call her. She has a new baby so I text her first and organise a time that suits her. I then text my friend and see if she wants to do a video call. We organise a time for that too. While waiting for my catch up times I do some jobs around the house while listening to an audio book or interesting podcast. Just before my first catch up time I make a coffee and get a healthy morning snack ready so I can sit down and chat with my sister. Afterwards I spend time in the garden and cleaning out my animals pens (I have a lot 😂). And then come inside a few minutes before I am due to video call my friend and get a tasty lunch together and spend the next hour chatting and laughing with my friend. I spend the rest of the day feeling happy and connected. I enjoy going for an afternoon walk. I live in the country so social isolation not a problem and finish the day readying a good book. 😊,JS,,7,5,5,5,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,0

It’s hard to feel motivated to do anything but I know that this is not good for me and I try and set aside some time to mull it over - I like solving other people’s problems, why am I so resistant to trying to solve my own?

I try to determine when I feel most lonely. Am I thinking about particular things or people at those times? Are there key people or types of people I am particularly missing contact with? 

Come to think of it, are there times I feel more content? What am I doing or thinking in those times? Is there something I enjoy that I might be able to share with other people?

I would like to try and find times I am happier and bring the people I am missing in to experience those with me if possible. Can I reach these people? Do I know anyone that might be able to join me in the things I enjoy?

I should get in touch with some of the people whose company I miss and who make me smile, I might try social media or texts. I have been meaning to try and catch up with people I used to see daily and whose conversation I miss. I see my colleagues in team meetings but that can still be lonely, we are talking as a mass and not as individuals.

I wonder if I should join a group of people who share my hobbies, there seem to be more popping up that invite remote participation and maybe someone can recommend something? Can I engage with people I don’t know yet remotely? Won’t it be awkward?

The colleague I got in touch with has sent a nice long list of things they think I’ll enjoy, and has recommended a virtual meet-up group to me. I am not looking forward to the first virtual event with people I don’t know but I agree to join anyway. 

These new people are great and I’m enjoying getting to know my colleague better outside work as well. I leave the first session with a big smile and tell my partner all about the new friends I’m making.

I pass the word on to other colleagues in our next team catch up; that I’ve joined a new group and made some new acquaintances who share similar interests. I feel that I have more people to talk with and I’ve also encouraged others to try something similar. I now feel connected and closer to people.",KH,,2,3,1,0,1,1.5,0.5,0,1,1.5,0.5,0,0

So I nosedived, and felt very isolated and lonely.  And lost a much loved person in the UK to covid over Easter;  he was a kind of 'big brother' to me when i was younger.  Ho - bottom of the treacle well.
BUT all was not lost - I was lucky to have two singles living close to me, who knew and they reached out to me.  I as usual was prickly and didn't want help but they pushed.  
And shared their problems.  That was a key point -- we all 3 have difficult adult sons, and problems which were surprisingly similar.  So we fell into the habit of chatting regularly, and of course in such a community we meet on the street.  Then we set up a weekly card game.  I responded to a community callout to help those who needed it (eg a new single home owner, social isolation and has no car!) to offer to help, eg shopping, etc.  Or computer help as I'm quite good at that.
So, it was a question of opening up to other people, admitting my own difficulties,  being truthful and less prickly and self absorbed.  I am not alone in this, but also need to learn not to go overboard and offer more than I am really willing to give on a regular basis - it's OK to set boundaries.  Also, I have a Jack Russell terrier who needs exercising, I cannot walk far so I use a mobility scooter.  Just going up and down the streets and into the green spaces I see / talk to others every day and it helps.  I feel better, and I managed to get on top of a couple of tasks that had been hanging over me.  But the best of all is what follows:
I received an anonymous card in my (community) mailbox. with a pic of a koala.  The message read:
Hi Gina,  Hope you like this card.  It's to let you know that you are cared about very much.  I love to see you ride past on your scooter with a smile always on your face.  It's been a very sad time for you just lately, but I'm hoping you feel better soon.  You have friends who care.  x  x  x 
I checked all the usual suspects who all hotly denied it, and my widow friend over the road remarked 'if it was anonymous the person wants to be anonymous - stop hunting it down and just accept the kindness'.  Sage advice.
So now I feel better, more able to tackle tasks, and more accepting of my own shortcomings.  We so often hound ourselves for our failures and downplay our good bits.  I'm not so bad after all.",JS,,5,5,5,5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,0

I have joined a volunteer group to help support vulnerable people.

I shifted house about 2 1/2 years ago and haven't made friends in is neighbourhood.

I am very shy and introverted and I do not know how to improve my situation.
I volunteered for the CARE army but I have not been contacted.
In my story I am not feeling connected and closer to people.

Then I’d sift through my mind what jobs/errands I need to do today.... being retired, everyday is fairly flexible on what I get up to. My husband had written 6 books so he happily keeps himself busy in his office and we enjoy coffee/tea breaks today along with our meals.
I see I have a dentist appointment so I call my mum and ask if I can get them any groceries as Woolworths is right next door to the dentist. Keeping busy keeps negative thoughts away. Sometimes I don’t know why I feel down, maybe I didn’t sleep well or I’m sad about a problem on of our kids are experiencing. Our combined 6 kids are all independent and we have 8 grandkids tho none live close with the majority of the family living a 19-12hr drive away. I don’t do a video call as I feel it’s best not to do so if I’m feeling low. However doing some housework, connecting with others online make that fade into the distance. I go to the dentist and enjoy the catch up there. I grab groceries for my parents and drop inside their door then chat to them from the outside for a short while. Seeing if there is anything they need. Mum is 81 and Dad 89. They live in a retirement village. 
I head home and pull the washing off and think about dinner. Hubby asks me to walk with him and when we return home, I’ve found it really enjoyed it esp as I missed my morning walk. We sit on the balcony and enjoy a sundowner together as the sun sets. Afterwards we have dinner and settle down to watch a movie together. In bed we each read for awhile.

We don’t have a lot in common (never have) but we are frank and open with each other. She is alone at home so I know that she is usually available. It surprises and irritates me that she doesn’t call me, instead she sends lots of annoying social media posts or funny GIFs. I think that’s her way of reaching out to say hello. Her excuse is she doesn’t know if I’m available and that makes me feel vexed.
If the time difference was wrong or if I still felt lonely after the call with her, I would try to phone some of my close friends.
If nobody answered my call I would send a message and hope that one of them was able to get back to me later on.
If I really wanted to reach out I would write an email to a range of people (family and friends) asking about everyday things or I might post something on social media and see who responds. This is rarely an option to improve a sense of loneliness for me. I read comments on social media posts and think how shallow people are. If I thought someone was reaching out I would call them and not 👍 or ❤️ them. Makes me sad that our method of communicating with each other has been reduced to this drivel.
If I really wanted to connect with someone I would invite them around for a cup of tea or now we can have friends over for dinner.

2. Write down my goal somewhere. Maybe on my PC screen (e-post-it). At the very least a post-it note the sticks to the PC itself but maybe an A4 or a Word document that I can open up and add to about how I am progressing vs. the goal.
3. Write down some of the thing I have tried in the past in a list and determine whether they are appropriate now. 
4. Google the goal. Get some ideas from the net. Write down in a word doc or on paper the ones I think are either or both interesting or achievable. Rank them by both 'Optimyum to achieve the goal and ""I could do these successfully' as opposed to 'the idea is interesting but don't think I want to do that'
5. Select 3-5 ideas of the 'top ranking' ideas to do over the next 1-2 weeks. 
6. Set an incentive - e.g. a DVD I've wanted or sports clothing or even a new electronic gadget - along with a specific outcome (eg I will have tried 3 out ion the 5 ideas for a minimum of 1-2 hours)
6.Select 1 thing to do TODAY. Small / Easy thing to do. A 'SMART (Specific, Achievable. Time-bound etc)' goal. Do it today with a self-reward (chocolate bar) or tomorrow and no reward. This sets an immediate incentive.
7. Don't move forward with any other actions until completed and assessed how I did. If it didn't work, put it in the 'Too Hard' basket or 'Try again later'. It's OK to fail. It's not OK not to try at least a bit...
8. Work though the list, one at a time until some achievement towards the goal. Write up achievements and note failures and what I'm doing wrong. 
9. If possible check with someone trusted/close/non-judgemental how I'm doing... even the doctor if no-one else.

Over the years, pre-pandemic, I've lost a great deal of trust in others, for  many reasons. So visualizing this is very challenging.

If; and, it's a BIG if, I were to connect with others,  properly, I would call, text, one or two people, to have morning tea, lunch; or, afternoon tea with them. Usually, I would do this in a park; where we have BYO lunch.
Conversational catching up would  occur.
This would be repeated fortnightly.

Similarly, I would plan for regular walks with friends, by calling or texting to arrange this.

Sadly, I have found that others are frequently too busy. In many ways the pandemic hasn't changed things.
I've felt isolated for years; in spite of trying to connect with others as above.

Sorry to give such a conflicted answer. I work really hard at dealing with social isolation at any time; however, I find it a challenge to visualize positive outcomes because my lived experience hasn't been entirely successful.

This would have different categories: 1) my wife and child (but I would worry about putting too much pressure on my child, so I would really reach out to my wife and try to enjoy my child more 2) my sister and mother who live interstate 3) my close friends, many of whom also live interstate 4) my colleagues and co-workers.
For feeling isolated and lonely I would already think I am spending time with my wife, but I would talk to her about it, and about my need to reach out to others.
I would reach out by telephone/facetime and email to my sister and mother. I would call my mother more regularly, perhaps even daily for a while, just to say hi and check in.
Then, I would think through about my close friends who live interstate and think, who is the best to talk to in this situation. So I would think about who is most likely to be sympathetic, but also who might have time (eg do they have young kids), and I would reach out first by text message to arrange a time to chat. Then I would call them and have chats. I have, in fact, been doing exactly this over the last two months, reaching out to good friends but people who I don't see regularly because we don't even live in the same city. And there are two in particular who I can talk to about my feelings, even if I'm feeling bad. So we would talk about our jobs, but also about our feelings.
Then I would see if I could work out justifiable reasons to be able to go in to work occasionally, where even though there are not a lot of people around (because almost everyone is working from home), you can still get to see people face to face, albeit at a distance. Again, I have done this in the last two months because I have been having computer problems. So I would take my home computer in to work to get fixed, then bring home a work computer. But this would give me a reason to spend the whole day at work - my day is so full of meetings, etc, that there's not really enough time to commute in the middle of the day and still attend all my meetings effectively. So, once I go in to work for the day I usually stay for the whole day. And when I do that, I often reach out to the colleagues with whom I get on well, and who I know sometimes also go in, to see if we can go in on the same days. And if that happens, then we go for a walk together or have lunch together (across a big desk), so we are still maintaining social distancing but we are also making face to face contact.
Also, I call colleagues on the mobile more often than I used to. So part of the plan involves asking people via email for their mobile phone numbers, and then ringing them rather than sending an email. It is often easier to talk things through on the phone, and you can get more done so it works better for complex communication anyway, but the bonus is that I get to talk to more people.

LIST: 
1. Make a concerted effort to contact my old friends Jane, Vicky, Anita, Sally, Rosemary, Linda, Richard, Georgie, Bridget, Shaz, Anya via phone,  text, email or skype. 
Firstly make a list of my friends - Type a generic email and alter for each individual putting in personal touches. Wait for replies and continue regular correspondence in the future. Send a text to make a time to call. (I feel I am quite lazy when it comes to keeping in contact with friends and I'm not surprised that I have few friends close by.) 
2. Learn conversational Spanish. Go through all my learn Spanish material. Do minimum 30 minutes practice daily. Enrol in a Spanish TAFE course when it opens again. Find free Spanish conversation possibilities via the internet This will help me feel more connected when I (hopefully) return to Spain for a holiday next year 
3. Start a small business selling propagated plants. 
Firsly, buy little pots and potting mix. Pot baby plants and ask my daughter to photograph these and more mature plants. Ask her to help me to set up a website to advertise and market them on the internet. I would get a lot of satisfaction earning money from my own venture rather than relying on my husband.This activity will involve valuable and mentally active time spent with my daughter and make some extra cash
4. Enrol in the lifeline telephone counselling course. Call the local lifeline centre for information regarding training. If it's within my budget, commence training and I will be able to assist needy people with advice and feel connected with other counsellors. I feel I have a good deal of life experience and plenty of free time to give back to the community
5. Enrol in an art course. (Before Covid-19 I had joined one group and started to make friends but left as it was too costly)
Contact the Queensland arts centre to join and attend Friday $5 sessions if they are still on. I love painting, learning new techniques and being with like-minded people.

I'd like to feel more connected with others, which would mean spending time with them either face to face or via some other medium. There is no-one in the small town I live in I can connect to (music or yoga group) due to current restrictions, so it will have to be someone away from here. I get on well with my niece, but she is having exams and assessments at the moment, so is time-poor. I have another Aspie friend in another state - I haven't talked to her for a while, so I will text her and see if she has time to talk. If so, I will phone or skype - it's nice to see some facial feedback (auditory leaves me somewhat confused). I think she will be free next weekend - we will aim for a mutual time to connect. We will be able to talk about work and colleagues we have in common - I think we will both feel better connected after this.

And then, of course go through the list i had just made decide who i would love to speak to. An 'old friend' not acquaintance. Someone who or some inexplicable reason had drifted or gradually petered out, or just one day stopped writing , texting, or calling.
I would know how such a call from me, out of the blue, would please some, astonish some,be welcomed by some, ignored by some or possibly ignored by some, blocked , maybe, by some.
Then, I would, feeling happy, confident and ready to hear their voice again call them.
Shivers of nervous energy cascading like waves, i would encounter as it rang, and rang and then finally the familiar voice, probably saying ""OMG, Hello"". 
I'd feel my body relax, strengthen and the finally say
""Ya know what, you are such a little f****r. What, I suddenly became superfluous, you dropped your phone down the loo ? 
Or still just a complete dick for not even bothering to call me after all the help and time i spent on you. 
Not to mention everything else you drained me off. So as we all have extra time at the moment to think and remember, I thought I would take ths opportinity to tell you, 'Congratulation. You've won 'The Co-Vid 19 Award for 2020'. It is awarded to the person that has the most things in common with the Corona Virus. And you my friend appear to have an endless list of similarities.

2 You make more people sick, by being you than the virus
3 You are less welcome in homes, than the virus
4 You made the curve currently attempting to be straightend

I would identify my feelings with compassion and think about how best to manage them, bearing in mind what has worked for me in the past.  I need a structure and strategy not to cave in to feelings of loneliness and isolation and despair..  I would also reassure myself I have my weekly appointment with my therapist which is my safety net.  Food is important too.  I know how it affects my mood so I would make sure I eat the right things to help me feel stable and don’t become too hungry.
I know that my yoga practice improves my mood, calms me, increases my creativity and energy levels so I would do that first.  It sets the scales for the day. Then I’d be ready to engage with my art practice hopefully losing myself in its flow listening to the radio or music that feels right.  I know it’s important not to get overtired so I would try to pace myself.  Overdoing is as bad as not doing enough.  I might then walk or read a book depending upon whether my artwork has gone well - if it hasn’t I can return to negativity and exercise helps dissolve such thoughts.  I would try not to panic over my feelings, remember they will pass and equally calm deep breathing can help.  If I feel physically tired and creatively productive I will feel satisfied with myself and my closeness and connection to others becomes stronger.",LL,CP,19,8,9,6,9.5,4,4.5,3,9.5,4,4.5,3,0

From constantly feeling down and blue, unmotivated and thinking whats the point, waking up and facing another day, just like every other day, this is a huge ordeal. Procrastination has become a new problem and with no motivation I literally have to fight the demons to make this happen. 

From choosing what to wear, putting on makeup and doing my hair, (to look human in public!) takes quite a lot of effort and time, way more than it should but feel its worth it because it gives me confidence in public and I feel that if I give the impression that if I'm still put together in appearance then it hides whats going on inside.

After walking around in circles for too long than I feel comfortable with, I make myself leave the house and walk down to the local shops. I feel anxious and kind of afraid for some reason.

Once I have talked to a couple of shopkeepers and a couple of random strangers on the way I'm starting to feel a lot better. My mind is otherwise occupied while engaging with people so the angst is kept at bay during this time.

When I return home I felt great about making myself get out and about and feel connected with people and not so isolated and lonely.

Everything on radio, TV from the PM's addresses spoke about families during the pandemic.
To feel less isolated and alone I knew I would need to 'see and talk to people'.
Initially I thought I would escape to Melbourne to be with my sister and her partner if we were going into a lockdown. I left my running to late. ( Probably a good thing as I would have out stayed my welcome by now!)
Fast forward until now and if I am feeling isolated I know I can, text and see if a friend wants to come for a walk either in a park or around the local streets. It's great if a friend can join me. 
I also would text to see if a friend would like to come over for lunch or afternoon tea. I would plan something to make and look forward to their company. Doing this makes me feel connected. 
If I'm not able to meet up with a friend I would call or text a friend to have a chat.
I have a few friends I 'see and chat' to each week on either through Zoom, Facetime or Messenger.

I would offer children in the street to play cricket with our children on the street, I would get to know the parents of children and invite them to our house if they would like to have a swim in the pool or to play. I have walked our dogs to many parks and met some nice dog owners nearby. I have joined a gym and have participated in events offered such as bush walks and picnics so I can get to know other members and the staff better. I have stayed in touch with friends and family in Victoria via phone, video, social media and text/email. I have volunteered at our sons' football club and got to know coaching staff and other parents. I have met parents at our sons' school and my husband and I have been to a parent event to meet others. I have also met many of my husband's work colleagues. My nephew is now staying with us and we have been going away together on weekends (whilst travel restrictions have eased) so we can enjoy the beautiful Queensland environment. Last weekend we met up with some old friends of over 12 years. I feel more connected and closer to people since arriving in January, despite being socially distanced for the past 9+ weeks.

Other than that I am blessed to have friends who care and we keep in touch by phone or text.
It’s very hard to imagine what I would do in your scenario because it implies someone having no-one to care about them which is awful.  

If there really were no family or friends, I guess I would reach out to some of the amazing services like Lifeline or Beyond Blue and hopefully get support and ideas from them.  I would try and interact more with neighbours and see if there was anyone in my area that I could help ... you get back so much more than you give when times are tough (and any time really).  Offering to help through volunteering can introduce you to all sorts of people who would love to keep in touch and hopefully make your loneliness and isolation a thing of the past.

I would then write to my closest friends asking about their work and things they like to do in these times. Then I would put on some nice music to get into a good mood, and start with recording some videos of me giving beautiful speeches to my loved ones, then editing the videos with photos of them and me, and finally I would send it and ask them when we could have a video call. I would feel like I have accomplished something gorgeous and enjoy spending time with awesome people, while scheduling new meetings for the next few days.",KH,,5,5,5,5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,0

I was kind of depressed as I lost my job and was undertaking my course online and most of the time my mind was so empty . As days passed, I decided to engage myself in activities like learning new skills, watching motives and I also got in touch with people via social media platforms. In the mean time, I got so attached with my home mates. I shared a lot with them and got too know a lot from them which gave a feeling that I’m getting connected and loved by people.

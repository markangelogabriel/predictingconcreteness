Make a cup of coffee, sit in my favourite chair with my dogs, and either phone, sms, or message several of them. Ask about their day, find out how theyâ€™re coping at present, and ask about their family.

I knew only 3 people here and one of them very close. 
My new place needs some renovations so I got that started and it is still ongoing so I get to chat with the tradespeople every day, and on the odd occasion we share a beer on Friday afternoon.
I contacted my two friends living here and one of them we went on walks together which has been great to learn about my new place.
My other friend I visit and take coffee as he is incapacitated at the moment waiting for an operation  and I just check in on him as well through the phone.
My friends I left behind we are in regular contact by phone and my brother and daughter/son-in-law who all live overseas regularly contact me via what's app or face time, and we share photos - me of the renos and my brother of his new grandaughter and my daughter of her travels and location.
I have joined a volunteer group to help support vulnerable people.
And today I met a man on my walk who is a historian and gave me his card with a website on to find out about my new place.
I have met my  neighbour across the road and chat with him when I see him outside his place.
My very close friend I see regularly which means we have to break the distance travelled rules but that changes this weekend - we have both been distancing with others, but she has been my real feeling of connection and support as well as my daughter and brother.
So these are the steps I have made to feel connected and closer to people.",0

I would also try contacting some golfing friends to see if they would like to play some golf.

Though there are many Virtual Choirs popping up, I am not very keen on joining any. Recording myself singing something which would then be seen on YouTube is not appealing.
Several other members might go this way but others are like me.

I would contact them and see if between us we could do some research.
Hopefully we might discover other Choirs online which are rehearsing some of the music we enjoy but without the need to record oneself singing.
We would pool our information and  let everyone else know which options we had found.
The end result might be that we each try various options and keep in contact with the others with results, opinions, suggestions until we can meet and sing again together.

Another tactic would be to download zoom and encourage family and friends to do the same. We could then have a zoom party. I would also google how to overcome loneliness and adopt any good ideas.

My husband and kids are totally sick of me as we haven't seen anyone else in a long time, whats the point of bothering someone, I don't think anyone really cares enough about me anyway. Everyone is probably enjoying themselves much more than me, I am not sure I am even worthy to bother anyone right now. I feel alone and feel like the lonliest person in the world. I decide that maybe just maybe I will ask my sister if she has the phone number from a person I was best friends with 20 years ago, I am about to send my sister a message but stall, - my mind wonders again, should i? Shouldn't i? Ugh, what should i do, maybe i wont bother. I change my mind and  get the number but feel very nervous and totally anxious in case i am rejected by her, we just lost contact when I got married.  I draft up an sms and read it, read it again. I run through all the memories i shared with this person in my head, i wish i never lost contact with her but she too never contacted me, I wonder if she is alone or lonely, how is she? is she happy? How would she re-act to my sms. Well. I decided to click the button and send the message... 1 hour goes by, 2 hours go by and then A MESSAGE came back (all while i couldn't breath as i was so nervous i wouldn't get a response) she replied and also states she has many fond memories of our freindship!

656,"I went to visit my sister and check on her as well as have the close connection, while observing the social distancing rules. At first I told her I was a bit reluctant to visit because she has Rheumatoid Arthritis and is at a higher risk. She said she was on the anti malaria medication they are trialing as a treatment for COVID 19. I went to visit her and it was great to connect and watch a movie together.  I had message and FaceTime calls with friends and that was a great thing to do. I had started cleaning out my house and simplifying my life, granted I was unable to actually get rid of unwanted things that I couldnâ€™t fit in the bin, but I have pile of things I want to dispose of. I was connecting with my students via Zoom and doing classes for them, that was great because I got to see how they are all going and have a different kind of connection. Then I came up with an idea about a possible way to deliver online content that could be purchased as an add on to regular training when we return to normal life and training again. It was at that time, I received an email from my old business coach. I was undecided at first, but I had an invitation to a free webinar with him, as a way of assisting fitness professionals during COVID 19. I joined the free webinar and got quite a bit from it. I then decided it was in my best interest to pursue the of avenue further development of my idea, as the one thing I did have was time. I Had a private session with him Via zoom and told him about my idea. He thought it was a sound idea, so after some financial consideration by me, I decided to sign up with him again. I am now in the process of working on my idea and have spoken to him a few times, this has given me the opportunity to have more personal interactions. My boss is retiring tomorrow, so we were trying to workout what to do for him, I suggested we do a zoom catch up for drinks. We did that tonight and it was great to catch with my work colleagues and wish my boss the best in his retirement. I am feeling well connected to my family, friends and work colleagues, thanks to messaging, FaceTime and zoom applications. ",0
759,"When the covid-19 stay at home started I felt that I missed going into my volunteer shifts at the childrenâ€™s hospital. Although I still miss my volunteers roll I am busy with learning how to bake different types of sourdough breads. I am looking forward to seeing and being a part of volunteers services again. 

I am looking forward to seeing my friends and having a coffee. I am also looking forward to get back to the choirs I sing in.

I do feel somewhat feel connected with one choir as we sing together on zoom. I always look forward to Monday. 

I keep myself happy and glass full by keeping in contact with family and friends by phone or Facebook and Instagram. 

I always bake to much for my family and gift sourdough to my choir family or my volunteers family or friends and neighbours. I am looking forward to sharing my newly learned versions ie ciabatta, baguettes, whole wheat, focaccia, cinnamon rolls etc.

77,"I would think about who I would like to feel more connected to - is it my spouse who I live with, or my family or friends, or even with myself. I think about why I am feeling lonely and isolated - itâ€™s because of self isolation, and not socialising in my normal routine. I think about what parts of that are within my control and can I change and what parts are out of my control and I canâ€™t change. I tell myself not to get caught up in the things I canâ€™t change and focus my energy into the things I can change. 
I focus on the people I want to connect with, my spouse and close friends. I think about why I want to connect with them - to share experiences, to feel reassured and to provide some respite from what is happening, and talk about things out loud rather than keeping them internalised. I decide how to connect with these people - itâ€™s a discussion with my husband, and a text message reaching out to my friends with quickly results in a video call with 2 friends at the same time.
I feel relief about sharing my feelings, and that my worries and feelings of isolation and loneliness are valid and justified, and real and normal. We share experiences and support eachother and admit that communication is the best medicine, and that we are all in this together even when weâ€™re apart. We discuss different ways to stay connected and manage our anxieties both individually and together. We reassure eachother that we are here for one another and that it is ok to feel down.

Iâ€™d start by gathering tools together - a little stool to sit on, a couple of different gardening tools, a neat fitting pair of gardening gloves, a couple of tissues, because invariably whe Iâ€™m in that position I feel the need to blow my nose. Iâ€™d then work my way along the path, removing as many weeds as I can, being sure to stand up and stretch every few minutes. This is quite a long, boring job and itâ€™s hard to get some of the weeds out. When Iâ€™d removed all those I can get to, Iâ€™d come back again with weed spray and spray the hard bits I couldnâ€™t get to.

Who can be trusted with which issues?  for example, children who are getting less work and stressed with child care and working.  Not always appropriate to discuss with just anyone.

Husband who is getting much slower at doing tasks around the house and not as quick at problem solving and organising tasks. Quite sensitive issues.  Feeling a don't want to betray his trust.

Initially I thought I would escape to Melbourne to be with my sister and her partner if we were going into a lockdown. I left my running to late. ( Probably a good thing as I would have out stayed my welcome by now!)
Fast forward until now and if I am feeling isolated I know I can, text and see if a friend wants to come for a walk either in a park or around the local streets. It's great if a friend can join me. 
I also would text to see if a friend would like to come over for lunch or afternoon tea. I would plan something to make and look forward to their company. Doing this makes me feel connected.

I am doing more walks etc with my wife as I am not currently working.
 I am a coach so I miss my training routines and my athletes. I don't wish to bother them and their families but I know that they would reach out if I needed them.
I am looking forward to the relaxation of the lockdown so I can concentrate on the coaching and planning for my athletes. This will then provide the better connection and closeness I currently miss.",1
826,"I call my son. He does not answer. I call his wife. She realises I'm anxious and decides we need to video chat. We face time and I get to talk to her and my granddaughters. Their giggles bring a big smile to my face. Their chatter and baby babble are so cute. We chat for over an hour and I'm feeling better already. Then my granddaughter says I miss you nanna but I know you can't come visit because of the virus. So I made you somw pictures. Mummy will post them. Then I video chat with my daughter and my grandsons. Little Mr 3 is a busy boy. We play hide and seek over the phone. He has me in fits of laughter at his games. He too has done some drawings foe nanna that will be posted. He tells me daddy is better from the virus and can play with him now.
Opening the mail a week later I have beautiful pictures from little miss 4 and she has written herself I love you nanna. Then I open the next one with hand prints and love hearts from my grandson. Absolutely beautiful. I put all the pictures on my wall and call them to say thank you. My heart melts and I long to give them a big cuddle but they live too far away. It will need to wait until the virus is gone. Video chatting for now each day and hearing all about their days that way. It's like I'm there with them without being there with them. I'm feeling loved.",0
46,"During isolation?
I would talk with my partner who I live with, ask to go for a walk or play cars because these are fun activities. Kick the footy in the park and see the dogs and people there, order a coffee from the cafe downstairs where I know the staff and the small talk with them is a nice connection. 
I would message a group chat seeing if anyone wanted to video call
Iâ€™d send snap chats to my family chat, play scrabble app with my sister, or phone my mum 
All of these activities make me feel connected ",0
776,"I would go through our church directory and mark each of the people living alone or possibly needing assistance. I would spend a morning phoning and checking in on how these people are coping, who they are connecting with, whether they need assistance with shopping or meals, and whether they would like help to be part of a weekly Zoom catch up coffee morning. During the week I would make meals specific to the needs I had ascertained, and contact a mobile friend to collect and drop off meals, medicines, and shopping for the isolated friends. The 40 minute Zoom coffee catch up allows everyone to share in a community feel and encourages them to also contact eachother through the week. I can check FB for our local â€œFood Trade and Barterâ€ to check if there is anything that people need that I might have an abundance of, and sign up with Care Army to volunteer assistance locally in any way I can. I am soon feeling very social and wonder how I ever found time to work when my life is so busy!",0

But I guess I don't know if they have their phone on either.  Perhaps I should ring them; but no they'll be busy with their families and work.  I wonder, maybe I could leave a message or send them a text.  Well, what's the worst - I guess if I ring and they're busy they might ask if they could call me back.  Or if it goes to voice mail I could leave a message. Well that's okay.  Okay, I'll call 5 people today.  Wow, even though I had to leave a message for 3 it was wonderful to speak to the other 2. :-)",0

I would space them out over a prriod of time so that I was interacting each day with one or more people. I would no longer feel isolated and I would feel closer and connected to people.",0

These events would happen and I would feel connected",0

- go for a walk, see people, say hello what a beautiful day today, i would have a chat to other people walking... I would connect with people then from walking kms saying hello to others, I am getting connected which boosts my inner energy... then stop over to the shop and buy the paper, say hello, talk rubbish to the shop owner, i get connected, go home, call friends and family, get connected and feel rebooted. simple. even if they are strangers, your energies are connected to others which boost your mind and body.Do I feel lonely, the answer is yes, but it does not control me, I control it!",0
908,"I would first acknowledge feeling lonely. I would turn to a quick solution like making tea or patting my dogs. If feelings still didn't dissipate, I would call a family member to just chat about our days to make myself feel connected to otger people. If feelings still persisted, I'd talk to a close friend or family member about my feelings of loneliness. Together we'd address what changes I could make to feel this less. I would then feel supported, heard, and less lonely ",0
297,I feel isolated and lonely as unable to see my regular friends in a group. I would start with listing the main friends I would like to catch up. The issue is I donâ€™t like imposing as everyone has their own issues.  I am not one for the phone either. I would start a group chat with via messenger selecting 2-3 friends. Then ask if they would like a FaceTime chat and arrange a day and time to suit. Then we can all interact and chat. I then feel connected and closer to them.,1
1225,"I would think about who I know and identify those that might be feeling the same.  I would then try contacting them via text, phone, social media etc to chat.  After we connected I would then think through what we have in common and suggest a virtual catch up engaging via a video chat over whatever it is we have in common, i.e. it might be cooking, so we could have a virtual dinner party, it might be enjoying a glass of champagne so we could both buy the same bottle and enjoy it together at the same time via a video call.  It might be walking by the water and we can chat whilst we go for a walk.  This way I can feel reconnected to others, not just by phone which isn't always enough, but also by seeing them, even if we can't be in the same location or touch.",0

I get my phone and peruse on Instagram and Facebook, this will get my mind of it and I can see what my friends are up to and send them messages.

I would then decide whether to call, text, email or visit and what time.
I would make sure I am in a sociable frame of mind.

I accepted a call from my friend and organised to get together. By visiting my friend I began to feel more connected and closer to people.",0

61,"The first thing I do when I feel overwhelming feelings such as this is write them down so I can understand where they are coming from. So I would write in my journal what these feelings of isolation and loneliness looked like and hopefully narrow it down to which part of my life was struggling. If I felt that it would help, I would go and find my Mum, she's usually free and would love a chat or a cuddle. Then I might ask if she wanted to go for a walk because fresh air helps me think more clearly. Then I might call or message my boyfriend if I felt that it would ease the specific feelings. I would usually tell him how I was feeling and ask if we could talk about a topic that I knew would sooth my feelings. In this case, it might be a funny story from the past or dreams about our future, whichever would bring up less anxiety. Then I might organise a zoom call with my friend group for later in the week. In these zoom calls we like to talk about the future as if it will be normal soon, rather than dwelling on the losses we have going on right now. After all this, if I was still feeling isolated, I could do a Smiling Mind mindfulness activity, listen to a podcast, make a cup of hot chocolate or watch some Netflix. Distractions usually help if you can't fix the problem. ",0

653,"Lately I am feeling isolated and lonely, so I decide I need to make some changes to feel more connected. First I think about all the people in my life that i have not been in contact with lately, those i have not connected with, those that have connected with me and I have ignored. I plan to contact two people each day. If I am feeling a little apprehensive I will text rather than ring, as it is easier. Once I have started contacting people I set up regular catch up times, moving from text and emails to phone calls and video chats. Each time I contact a person I commit to catching up with them again at the end of our chat. I ask them to reach out to me if I have not been in touch, explain that I have been feeling isolated and would really appreciate their help. I continue these calls, video chats, texts and emails, and make them part of my regular routine. So that it is no longer awkward or nervewracking to call anyone. All of this helps me feel connected and closer to people. ",0
475,I would like to feel more connected to other people.

I'd invite friends for a coffee or a drink and arrange a game of golf. I'd go for a walk with a friend in the bush. I'd volunteer to assist someone in need through the Care Army website and when they respond I'd make sure I go and help where required. ",0

I might suggest I'm having a cup of tea while I'm calling them to make it a bit more social.  At the arranged time I would call and have a lovely rambling conversation with no agenda.  After the call I might send a photo through of something we spoke about.  Later that night I might share a funny meme or clip that I had come across that I thought they might enjoy and it kind of prolongs the connection for me.

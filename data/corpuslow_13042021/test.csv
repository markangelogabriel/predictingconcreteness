I have a chat with the fellow who has the garden plot next to mine and to a few of the other community gardeners. They offer helpful advice about my garden (I am a novice vegie gardener) and also offer to water my fledgling plants during the week when I am at work. I leave feeling fresh, revitalised and in good spirits. After arriving home  my family call via WhatsApp and Hangout and we have a long cheerful conversation that also leaves me uplifted.

To connect to my family and friends they are as close as my mobile or landline a way.  I can text them, ring them or even zoom them. 3 I am quite content with my own company and as long as I have something to do to keep me occupied I am fine. I am a little concerned that I could become a bit selfish away from people so I try to make the effort to connect with other people not in my household.

I need to talk to and interact with people. I text people on a daily basis for my own sanity and to touch base with them as well. I do zoom or facetime calls to see people. When we were allowed two visitors we had some friends from our unit block into our house for a drink and a chat. The contact and interaction helped our mindset. I started walking with my daughter some mornings and its amazing how much better I feel by being outside, doing some exercise and actually talking to a real person outside my home.(other than my husband who I talk to all day). I need social interaction as I am a very social person.

I would think about my friends and see who I felt like getting in touch with. Then I would send some text/ Whatsapp messages to those friends. I would see if anyone replied quickly and call them for a chat. After speaking on the phone I usually feel a lot more connected and happy. I would also see if a friend wanted to meet up for a walk and then go for a walk together. Meeting up with someone in person really boosts my mood as we can chat and catch up more directly and for a longer period of time. When I do all of these things consistently I usually feel connected and less lonely in the world (and my head!).",0

During the day, I would text one of my friends who is also on maternity leave and see if she is free for a walk, where we could have a chat respecting the 1.5m distance. If no-one else was free, I would go to the shops to get my food shopping, taking the opportunity to say hello to the barista at the coffee shop.",0
352,I would firstly send a text message to my regular walking group to see if anyone wanted to have a walk because I like getting outside and exercising with someone different from those I live with.  If no one was available I would text or ring a friend or a family member for a chat because I like talking to people and checking in with them to make sure they are OK also.  My last resort would be to go out to the shops to get supplies and be with other people.  There is always someone who will have a short interaction.,0

- have a conversation over text about what has been going on in each other's lives. We may not directly reference the feelings of isolation or loneliness, but just having the interaction lessens the feelings as the interaction continues.
- if I still feel somewhat disconnected, repeat, otherwise SMS a close friend (although she is notorious for not responding quickly), but the action of messaging her even seems to help lessen the feeling

Some i know have not been contacted for over 2 years.
I know that it would bring up memories, some good, some not so much maybe.
And then, of course go through the list i had just made decide who i would love to speak to. An 'old friend' not acquaintance. Someone who or some inexplicable reason had drifted or gradually petered out, or just one day stopped writing , texting, or calling.
I would know how such a call from me, out of the blue, would please some, astonish some,be welcomed by some, ignored by some or possibly ignored by some, blocked , maybe, by some.
Then, I would, feeling happy, confident and ready to hear their voice again call them.
Shivers of nervous energy cascading like waves, i would encounter as it rang, and rang and then finally the familiar voice, probably saying ""OMG, Hello"". 
I'd feel my body relax, strengthen and the finally say
""Ya know what, you are such a little f****r. What, I suddenly became superfluous, you dropped your phone down the loo ? 
Or still just a complete dick for not even bothering to call me after all the help and time i spent on you.

It also reminds me of times when I am back in my home country with family with the television switched on and us having a good time together. These memories might make me feel a little sad and wistful but they can be quite comforting. 

I will scroll through my phone to see which messages from friends and family I have not responded to. I will estimate how much cognitive and emotional effort it would take to reply to each, and also consider the importance of these people to me, before deciding which people I will reply to first. I will likely feel stressed and tired at the thought of having to hold conversations even via text, but I will persist, knowing it is good for me and that it will bring me closer to people I care for. 

I might even schedule virtual meet ups with one or two close loved ones, to make sure I do not withdraw into my isolated shell, since scheduling these will mean I have to do it. I will probably be reluctant and worried that I might feel really unhappy at having to do so when the time comes around to carry out the meet ups because it is easier to be alone when I am down. But I am likely to convince myself to do it and not overthink things because again, I know this is beneficial for me.

I would then visit my friend and just sit and chat for a few hours. Just sitting and chatting with him eases my mind. Leaving me feeling connected and closer to people.,0
379,"I would get on the phone and ring or text a couple of my male mates or my female friends since we were children.Have a laugh, with ongoing texts. Or a down to earth talk to a couple of my GENUINE m/f friends.",1

I would then arrange a suitable time for the FaceTime.
I would then have a great chat to my family/friends and feel better and not so lonely or down",1
845,"At this time, I still am not wanting to mix with people face to face. I would arrange to make a video call with my close group of friends. I would send a message in our group chat to find a night this week that would suit everyone. 
I also have some friends that I like talking to on the phone. I find this cheers me up more than video calls. I would send a text to those friends asking when they are free to have a chat this week. 
I know that my grandma is on her own and is usually available most days. I will call her now to chat on the phone. 
This will cheer me up and the promise of some phone/video calls in the near future will make me feel more connected to friends ",0
532,"I would make a list of all the people that matter to me the most. I would then contact them to arrange a time for a phone call or a video chat. My goal would be one per day so that across the span of a week I would have in-depth conversations every day.
I would also undergo small projects to reach out to those I care for. This would be in the way of a hand written letter in the post so that they would receive a nice message a week or so after we spoke. I would also facilitate a virtual games night where friends and partners can join and we have a light hearted couple of hours to be together.",0
236,"I feel more connected with other people by applying my skills to help them or by being useful to them.  I especially like solving problems, which I did in my professional career (retired now).  So I'll look for new volunteer opportunities through the internet and existing opportunities with organisations that I already have some relationship (current contacts). I recognise that since I'm in a risky age group, organisations might not want me involved during covid-19, so I think that the most likely roles might be with current organisations who know me.  Where I find ""positions vacant"" new opportunities, I'll submit formal applications (e.g. Red Cross).  Otherwise, I' make cold calls to organisations such as meals-on-wheels or St Vincent de Paul and offer my services. I already have police checks, working with kids and disabled.  For current organisations, I'll contact decision-makers and offer my services that might include maintenance of equipment, gardens or buildings.  I'll raise a discussion about up-coming events or items on their wish-list.  Since I've now made contact with a number of people, I already feel connected with people regardless of whether I found a role.  If nothing is found, I repeat the process in a day or two and expect to find something.  [BTW, I'm not good at play acting, which I've done above.  I already volunteer with a number of organisations which keeps me in contact with a range of people of all ages and ability.  I feel good when I've useful.]  ",0
1048,"I will start looking into digital social platforms where I can find new faces. 
Randomly pick people from different parts of the world and become friends with them.
Try to stay connect with new friends as much as possible, learning new things from them that could be a new hobby, useful discussions, advises, etc. 
Renew the old friendships in social media and stay connect with old friends.
Having more face time with immediate family, and close relations.
Eventually, I'll be busy with connecting people and my original thoughts of loneliness will be faded away.",0
106,"I would send a message to one of my close friends or family members asking them how they are and whether they would like to have a video chat or virtual movie night sometime in the next week (preferably a night later in the week so I would have more time to look forward to it).
If we decided on a movie night, together we would brainstorm (via a msg app) movies we could watch.
On the movie night, we would each watch the movie in our own homes and either msg each other through the course of the movie, or video chat during it. 
After the movie, we would catch up on how each of us is going, giving each of us a chance to vent if needed.
After this I would feel like I had spent quality time with someone I cared about, while doing something fun as well as giving and receiving emotional support. ",0
905,I would think about who I would like to interact with. Then I would text them and suggest meeting for a walk. I would arrange a time and place over text or call them to make arrangements. We would go for a walk and have a talk and make arrangements for another walk and talk. I would feel more connected with them.,1

476,I would think about some friends with whom I've lost touch or who  might get a lift by having a phone call from me.  I'd think about the time of day it might be best to catch them for a chat and ring them.  Before ringing I might think about how the conversation might go and what we might do to keep better connected in the future.,1
464,"I would reach out to my partner and friends. I would message my partner and tell him about my feelings of isolation and loneliness and make some plans to see him, play video games, or just chat over the phone. I would also text my friends and let them know what is happening. I would feel better having talked to these people as they make me happy.

I would feel much lighter and hopeful about the coming days.",1

For those I can't meet one on one, I either arrange to chat to them over video link or continue interacting wiuth them via text  ",0

I would also plan another interaction the next day or so to checkin again and stay well",0
1017,"I would call a close friend for a chat, and engage with them. I would call a different friend each day and continue the cycle.

Some I would send letters, cards, or Australia Post e-postcards. I would continue to do my volunteering by Zoom etc. even though the process is not that satisfactory. I have contacted a volunteer colleague who is isolated because of lack of technology and offered to send him an iPad and cheap smart phone. In the meantime I have found a cheap introductory SIM deal and put it in the iPad for him. I await his response.",1
319,"We have planned to have family over this weekend. It's nice to have the week to prepare clean, organize meals. This plan has taken many face time calls and texts which has been nice.",1
219,"As in my experience its by giving to others that we gain 10 fold personally, and that its when we are outside our own problems & our concern is on other people  that we experience the most happiness and joy. I would do a compassion meditation in the morning to send thoughts and love to everyone from my close family to strangers & myself. If my heart hurt from lonliness I would physically place my hand on my heart and acknowledge how I felt and pause, after meditation I would then hug & kiss my husband or my dogs or both then i would make a coffee and call a couple of close girlfriends, then as the day goes on I would make some food (covid safe cookies) & call my neighbors to the fence and give it to them/ or make an anzac wreath for people to put on fence(done this), I may make a skirt for my daughter I would do this whilst listening to either a podcast ""the moth"" or a dharma talk by Tara Brach and then listen to Hauser cello. At night cook a meal with hubby and have some beer/wine..call family & text kids. Watch a movie whilst reading a good book and by then I would feel like i was connected. Do my gratitude journal before bed and be thankful that I am safe, healthy and live in Australia",0
697,"If i were feeling isolated and lonely, as i have in the past but not recently, i would first remind myself how lucky i am to have some very special people in my life who love me/care for me very much.
If i were having a particular bad day i may struggle to think of who these people are but fortunately i thought to write a list of the names of â€˜my special peopleâ€™ in the front page of my diary.
So iâ€™d look at that list and get a feeling about who i would like to contact to talk to either over the phone or in person.
Iâ€™d also remind myself not to contact my parents as as much as iâ€™d like to, speaking with them when iâ€™m feeling bad always ends up with me feeling much much worse...even if that seems impossible.
If the first person i choose to call is not available, iâ€™ll call someone else on my list.
After speaking with &/or spending tine with my friends iâ€™ll feel much better, more connected, less lonely & very lucky to be worthy enough to have such people in my life.
*Special note... i have not felt isolated & lonely in a very long time as i have a wonderful husband (we married 10 years ago last month) & a 9yr old â€˜fur childâ€™ Jolie the Labradoodle. I also live in a lovely estate with a number of neighbours who have become good friends living near by.",0
357,"I would contact a friend living close by and find out how they are keeping.  Then I would ask them what they have been doing.  I will then tell them what I have been doing to keep busy.  I will then enquire when we would be able to visit each other, still keeping social distancing in mind.  I will then let my friend know what information I have on the latest update on social distancing and the relaxation of the restrictions.  I will then see whether we have a mutually convenient date we could meet up in the future and then plan for us to meet within the COVID rules.  ",0
918,"Acknowledge that these feelings of loneliness and isolation, although real, are situational and due to pandemic social restrictions.
Identify that these feelings can be resolved by connecting with others, other people are probably feeling similar.
Decide who in my family or friendship circle that I would like to like to share experiences with.
Establish the best method of contact (voice call, text message, FaceTime) and make contact.
Continue regular contact via these methods, especially on the days when I donâ€™t feel like connecting with anyone. 
Register with the care army. Identify friends, family, the elderly that may require additional assistance during this time with shopping, medication runs, meals, loneliness and provide these services when I am able.
Take a walk, exercise regularly to ensure positive mental health and physical movement. Also a good opportunity to connect with other like minded members of the community.
This should result in feeling more connected to friends, family and the community.",0

As a result of this encounter, we have made arrangements to meet regularly to walk together and increase our fitness levels.",0

I would get online and comment on somethingâ€™s that interest me or someoneâ€™s projects or post pics of my projects and interact that way. I would hang out with my kids and check in with them &get snuggles. I would call and text my family or post on our WhatsApp chats. I would ask One or a few work mates to sit outside for lunch or do something nice for them like bring in food or coffee. I would write a nice letter to my partner and show him how much I love him by doing chores at his or make a nice meal.

I would let them know how I am coping, let them share their feelings and offer them support. Most times people just need to offload. I would end with an offer of a future catch-up.

I'd make sure to look them in the eye and smile as we pass 1.5 m apart from each other, acknowledging those across the street, too, with a smile or a nod.
